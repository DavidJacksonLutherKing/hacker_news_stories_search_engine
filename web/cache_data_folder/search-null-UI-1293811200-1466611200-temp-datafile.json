For example some Japanese and Chinese characters will now display.\n    MediaKit's support for decoding and encoding file formats has been improved.\n    Addition of a general MIDI SoundFont by Tim Brechbill which enables support for many BeOS MIDI applications.\n    New IMAP implementation. Mails are now synchronized with the server and not just downloaded like in POP3.\n    The mail daemon replacement (MDR) and parts of the Mail Kit have been rewritten. MDR crashes are fixed now.\n    Integration of StackAndTile, which was originally pioneered by the University of Auckland (available via setdecor SATDecorator).\n    Additional window management controls for moving and resizing windows (CTRL + CMD + first mouse button and CTRL + CMD + second mouse button).\n    Update of the secondary and experimental compiler to GCC 4.4.4 (available via setgcc gcc4).\n    Support for weak symbols and symbol preemption in GCC 4.\n    The user interfaces of several programs have been overhauled and include BootManager, DiskUsage, MediaPlayer, ReadOnlyBootPrompt and ShowImage.\n    The locale support was extended and consolidated to use a single backend (ICU) for both Haiku's native and POSIX's locale API. The interface and reliability of the Locale and Time preflet were improved considerably.\n    More applications now use Haiku's Layout API, making their GUI's more resilient to font changes and localization. Furthermore, the layout API has continued to progress towards being stable and public. However, this API is not finalized: it may change at any time, so developers beware.\n    Support for PAE (Physical Address Extension) was implemented, so that physical memory beyond 4 GiB is used now.\n</code></pre>\nMissing Features<p><pre><code>    Haiku does not yet support WPA encryption for wireless networking, only WEP encryption is supported.\n    Package management is still being developed and is not included in this release. For the time being, a temporary script is included to help install a small set software (available via installoptionalpackage).\n    USB keyboards attached to OHCI or to USB 2.0 hubs do not work in Kernel Debugging Land (KDL). They need to be connected to UHCI root ports to work in KDL. Also note that when entering the kernel debugger by means of a panic it is possible that the keyboard does not work.

An infertility diagnosis is given to a sexually active couple that has been unsuccessful in efforts to conceive not using any birth control,over the course of one full year. When the cause of infertility exists within the female partner, it is referred to as female infertility. About 40% of cases are due to female factors,30% are due to male factors, 20% are a combination of both, and in about 10% the cause is unknown. Female infertility factors contribute to approximately 50% of all infertility cases, and female infertility alone accounts for approximately one-third of all infertility cases. Causes of infertility are many and varied and involve male, female or a combination of factors. They include problems with the production of sperm or eggs,the structure or function of male or female reproductive systems and/or hormonal and immune conditions in both men and women.<p>What causes female infertility?<p>If a woman keeps having miscarriages, it is also called infertility. Female infertility can result from physical problems, hormone problems, and lifestyle or environmental factors. The most common causes of female infertility includes the following<p>* Problems with ovulation\n* Age can contribute to infertility because as a woman ages, her fertility naturally tends to decrease. \n* Problems with the reproductive tract (e.g., blocked or damaged fallopian tubes, endometriosis, pelvic adhesions, benign uterine fibroids, and complications\n  from surgery or infection).\n* Sexually transmitted diseases \n* Smoking, drinking alcohol, or using recreational drugs (e.g., cocaine and marijuana).\n* Medications such as antidepressants,tranquilizers, calcium channel blockers,narcotics, and anti-cancer drugs.\n* Exposure to radiation, lead, toxic fumes and pesticides.\n* Incorrect timing of intercourse relative to ovulation.\n* Medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease, liver disease, sickle cell disease, and chronic infections including HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B or C,and        tuberculosis.\n* Overweight or underweight<p>Diagnosis of female infertility.<p>Doctors usually begin with a medical history about your menstrual cycle, past illnesses, sexually transmitted diseases and surgeries, and if you are taking drugs or have been exposed to toxic agents. The medical history is usually followed by a pelvic exam to make sure your reproductive tract (vagina, uterus, and ovaries) is normal, and blood tests to measure your hormone levels. A semen analysis and a medical history of your partner will also be performed. Depending on what is found in these tests, your doctor may also perform more specialized tests like Laproscopy,Hysteroscopy,Sonohystogram and ultrasound,of your reproductive tract, including one to make sure your fallopian tubes are not blocked. Tracking your ovulation through fertility awareness will also help your healthcare provider assess your fertility status.<p>Treatment options For Female Infertility<p>Treatment of infertility depends on the cause and the woman\u2019s age. It falls into two main categories: one helps fertility through medications or surgery, and the other uses assisted reproductive technologies. Fertility drugs are the main treatment for women with ovulation disorders, and may also be used in women with no identifiable cause of their infertility. These treatments may also be used with an intrauterine sperm injection (IUI), when sperm is injected directly into the uterus around the time of ovulation. Surgery may benefit women with fibroids, uterine polyps, or endometriosis. Surgery may also be an option when the cause of infertility is blocked fallopian tubes. It is important to note that attempts to unblock a fallopian tube may increase the risk of ectopic (tubal) pregnancy. Other options for a couple to achieve pregnancy include assisted reproductive technology such as mixing sperm with an egg outside the body (known as in vitro fertilization or IVF) or injecting a single sperm into an egg (known as intracytoplasmic sperm injection or ICSI), then transferring the resulting embryo back into the uterus. For women with very few remaining eggs in the ovaries,egg and embryo donation are options. Surrogacy is also one of the option for infertile couples.<p>Can female infertility be prevented?<p>If the female infertility is caused by genetic problems or illness then nothing can be done to prevent it. However, if women takes following steps ,she can decrease the possibility of infertility:<p><pre><code>    Take steps to prevent sexually transmitted diseases\n    Avoid illicit drugs\n    Avoid heavy or frequent alcohol use\n    Adopt good personal hygiene and health practices\n    Have annual check ups with her gynaecologist or infertility specialist\n</code></pre>\nEmotional support During Infertility Treatment and Evaluation.<p>The inability to become pregnant can lead to a variety of emotions, including anxiety, depression, anger, shame, and guilt. In one study, 40 percent of infertility patients suffered with some type of psychiatric disorder; the most common diagnosis was an anxiety disorder (23 percent), followed by major depressive disorder (17 percent). Both men and women can suffer from these problems, which can further hinder a couple's ability to become pregnant. \nThe best approach for treatment of psychological distress related to infertility treatment has not been determined. However, some experts suggest relaxation techniques, stress management, coping skills training, and group support. Evaluation by a psychiatrist may be needed for some persons with significant symptoms of anxiety or depression.<p>When should someone contact an Infertility Specialist?<p>If a female is facing problems like abnormal bleeding, abdominal pain, fever, unusual discharge, pain or discomfort during intercourse and soreness or itching in the vaginal area then the female should contact the doctor or her infertility specialist at the earliest.<p>Confronting an infertility diagnosis can be difficult but it is an important milestone. It marks progress on your path to resolving your infertility.

Forget about IE.<p>I needed to figure out how to render text to the WebGL canvas - I won't say I have the perfect solution, but the general approach is to use a conventional HTML5 canvas, then copy it once per frame into a WebGL texture. There's something funky going on in this process - the textures get corrupted, and resizing the window leads to slowdown.<p>For the future I'd like to make the planets clickable and zoomable, maybe put in a search box to zoom to objects of interest. I'd like to build it up to a full catalogue of the Solar System - comets, the larger asteroids, dwarf planets - and maybe add the capability to put in known space mission trajectories.", "date": "2011-06-13"}, {"title": "Google URL Shortener for Android is out", "URL": "http://goo.gl/g4yRik", "text": "The fastest and prettiest way to shorten URLs and get their click analytics.<p>Shorten long URLs and squeeze them into fewer characters to make links easier to share, tweet, or email to friends.

Eggs from a donor are fertilized using the sperm of one partner: In this case the child will be genetically related to the one of the parents.Donor egg programme in India is anonymous.The birth certificate will be issued in the name of the intended father, with the surrogate not being mentioned in the agreement at all.<p>2.Sperm donation from one of the fathers, egg donation from someone related to the other dad: In this case the child is genetically related to each dad.<p>IVF procedure for gay men are not much more different than the regular ivf procedures. IVF (or in vitro fertilization) is the professionally assisted combination of the man's sperm and the donor's egg in a laboratory dish. Once the fertilization is complete the embryo is transferred to the surrogate mother with the expectation that it will implant and result in pregnancy. Multiple embryos can be implanted in order to increase the chances of success. In some cases, if twins are desired, 3-4 embryos can be transferred.<p><pre><code>    Chances for pregnancy will be better if more than one egg from the donor is fertilized. For this end, fertility drugs (technically known as gonadotropins) are given to the donor to stimulate the ovaries. This causes multiple eggs to develop in a given cycle rather than the regular single egg.\n</code></pre>\nYou are at the right place If you are thinking of gay surrogacy,same sex surrogacy,Lesbian Surrogacy,surogate mother ,Surrogate Motherhood ,Surrogate Mothers in India, Outsourcing gay Surrogacy to India,gay Surrogacy and Egg Donation programs, good surrogacy offers in india,surrogacy in india.<p>We have helped individuals from countries all over the globe build families through assisted reproductive procedures.If you would like more information on how to get started, please call or email our office to schedule an appointment with one of our LGBT friendly Suroogacy clinic.We offer surrogacy services to infertile couple,same sex couples,single parent to help them fulfill their dream of a family .<p>Now everyone can have baby, Everyone can Start Creating Families through Surrogacy and be a proud parent today by contacting  on their websites at http://www.surrogacymumbai.com/index.php/the-same-sex-couples.html or http://www.wewantababy.com or  or simply a phone call at +91 22 2655 2000 or +91 22 26405000", "date": "2011-09-07"}, {"title": "Front End Developer", "URL": "http://www.publicstuff.com/careers", "text": "PublicStuff is looking for a front end developer to take a prominent role on our growing product development team.

In Beta 2, you guys&#x2F;gals uncovered an array of bugs which have been patched, along with usability issues around user interaction and menu&#x2F;GUI simplicity which have been fixed&#x2F;updated.<p>Anyway, I have been taking a more <i></i>community oriented<i></i> approach to Draftin&#x27;s continued development. Basically, I am letting the users give large input as to what they would like to see in Draftin&#x27;, and I have been prioritizing development based on that input. Beta 3 is entirely community driven, consisting of all the most reported issues&#x2F;bugs. Hopefully Beta 3 brings a much more well rounded and bug free drafting experience!<p>#### Beta 3 contains the following updates<p>- Add flashing tab on various events throughout Draftin&#x27; if user is on another web page&#x2F;tab.\n- Play audible sound on various events throughout Draftin&#x27; if user is on another web page&#x2F;tab.\n- Fix UI issues in <i></i>My Cards<i></i> section where card rows are out of sync.\n- Make user profile display users cards. If you ever leave a draft&#x2F;the coordinator deleted the draft, you can now retrieve your last drafts cards from your profile.\n- Greatly improved Set selection UI.\n- Fix server error when users try to join the same draft twice.\n- Fixed issues with kicking users from a draft.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s all for Beta 3. I am calling this update a usability update as it touches on the main issues you all found in Draftin&#x27;.

These might be visual mock-ups or interface flows.<p>UX design (by which I mean, visual design and interaction design) has always had a fractious relationship with open source software (IMO). So why create a discussion board? I think designers work best by solving problems by themselves or with a small group of fellow collaborators. The large, distributed nature of many open source projects (with many developers) simply doesn&#x27;t work well for UX design.<p>A discussion board will allow anyone with a mock-up to post their idea and seek feedback from other designers or developers. They can then take on board that feedback or ignore it. Someone else may take that same idea and expand it in another direction (much like forking software).<p>The important point is that the seed of the interface idea comes from an individual or a small group of collaborators, not a committee or the wide open web. That may sound a bit undemocratic, but when everyone has a say in the design of a user interface, the result is often a UI that pleases no-one.<p>What do readers think? A good idea?

It was wishful thinking. On desktop things worked wonderfully, but unfortunately there is no getting around what was also true 8-years ago - browsers are just not able to support the fine tune detail required to stuff UI (animation, interactions and all)into an app on your device. Something that reacts well to a no-keyboard, thumb-based UI. Something as simple as focusing in and out of an input box still makes the keyboard and your UI go nuts.<p>After all this time I get the sense that the level of detail required to create a beautifully functioning app, and a browser&#x27;s ability to render a wide range of HTML, will never find a balance.<p>I think things haven&#x27;t improved as much as I&#x27;d would have hoped because of the security measures a browser must enforce in order to restrict a developer from hacking a user&#x27;s experience negatively. Therefor a developer, even one&#x27;s with altruistic ambitions, will never get the access they need to manipulate how the browser renders in a beautiful way.<p>Anyone have other thoughts on the matter?

Their customer support told me that I can report lost items in the receipt they email you after the transaction.  But wait, you need to confirm the transaction via your phone to receive the email receipt.  So if my phone was left in the car, how can I rate my driver and confirm the transaction, thereby receiving the emailed receipt?<p>I explained this to Lyft support over the phone, and was told sorry, cant help you.  You&#x27;ll have to issue a report online to get ahold of our lost and found team.  Its been almost 24 hours since I left my phone in the car.  I have issued 3 different tickets online, called their support 5 different times, and still have no clue if this driver has even been contacted yet.<p>I can&#x27;t expedite the process, because I need my phone to confirm the transaction.  Until I rate the driver, Lyft won&#x27;t email the receipt.  I cant imagine I&#x27;m the first person to leave their phone in a Lyft car, and this seems like a very critical reporting issue for how to handle a lost phone.

The two most common restrictions I've seen when applying to incubators are:<p>Chances are low if you're applying as a single founder.<p>Chances are low if you're applying as a non-coding founder.<p>I happen to fall into the worst part of that hypothetical Venn diagram.  The catch is that the app that I'm working on was selected as a Staff Pick in the Android Market back in January.  I'm not saying it's perfect (there's still a ton of work to be done) but it shows that it's possible to have success as a noncoding, single founder.<p>So, why is there such an emphasis on having a coding founder? Since I'm not a coder, I hired a great offshore team to develop the code based on my UI designs, process flows and logic, wireframes, an excel spreadsheet of the algorithms, and database requirements.  It's worth noting that I didn't throw piles of money at my team, in fact the first version, the one that was selected as a staff pick, cost me $300 to develop the code.  So why is this approach looked down upon by incubators?<p>I implement SAP for a living, and this style of work is done quite often. For example, much of the technical team is offshore while the functional team works onsite.  So why are startups penalized for taking this same approach when applying to incubators?  I'd argue that the ability to quickly scale your team based on current project scope is a very potent tool, which outweighs the argument that because of the time constraints of an incubator you have to have a code friendly cofounder to churn out code.<p>Just something I've been thinking about, I'm curious to hear what everyone else has to say.

We had couple of good offers to join, but we decided to do our own startup. We\u2019ve read all the essay's of PG, we have the hacker\u2019s attitude. We\u2019ve worked our asses off, we got one funding offer as well, but that was too low to do anything, we are based out of India. We\u2019ve all the latest technology stack, djang/jquery/orbited/apachemq and all.

We can provide services to simplify shipping, including cross-border shipments, increase buyer security and reduce seller fraud.  Deliver retailer-level product recommendations (Think Amazon\u2019s \u201cYou may also be interested in\u201d), and more. Our focus is the automotive market due to its size and my experience (I am [or was before this company acquired all my time and money] a fairly serious car guy, as are a few of the investors). I believe there is a large opportunity (and I have quantified it, the numbers are shocking) to improve classifieds seen on forums and message boards.<p>What has been accomplished so far: We have a fairly polished MVP (www.styckyd.com and partners.styckyd.com), a few customers and partners, a handful of others who are interested, a number of executed test marketing campaigns receiving above average CTRs and a current conversion of between 15-20% (This is unsustainable for the long term due to user acquisition cost [~$3] and resulting revenue per user but validates interest and is a viable solution to seed the system). I have previously secured funding for $150k and can secure more (As much as needed, if needed) for future growth and development but I\u2019m aiming to grow incrementally for the next few years through customer growth. We\u2019re using Rails and a number of gems/OS libraries and are hosted with Engine Yard/Amazon.<p>Some of the challenges you\u2019ll encounter: Developing solutions to negate all kinds of fraud, from credit cards to buyer and seller scams. Indexing all of the products of an industry from crowd-sourced information \u2013 how do we avoid, identify, and consolidate duplicates? How do we seamlessly integrate with a number of third party platforms (vBulletin, Static websites, Vanilla Forums, etc.) where the individuals may not be technical and will have a wide variety of hosting environments? Some of these have working solutions that will need to be improved and some are currently unsolved.<p>A little about me: I\u2019m a jack-of-all-trades type. I have spent ten years in B2B marketing and sales. I have successfully sold to middle management in small-to-medium businesses (selling &#60;$10,000 products), and executive management in large (sub F500, selling &#62;$500,000 products) businesses. I have managed industry-leading brands in both the construction and mining industries. I am an adept designer and a novice/intermediate front-end developer, all of the front-end work on the sites has been done by me. Both of these skills can be improved but it won\u2019t be our bottleneck in the short term, if it needs to look good and work well from a UI perspective I can make it happen. I am far stronger with front-end design than I am with back-end coding, I make many rookie mistakes (many of which I am not skilled enough to understand yet) but I do intuitively understand how to code and can quickly and easily grasp the structure and scale of the application. Lastly, I do not give up easily. I have been working on this for four years and have gone through many setbacks and overcome even more challenges. The road is long and the walls are high, but not insurmountable. I strive to be the best in everything I do. Although I accept that the path to success is lined with failure, at the end of the day losing isn\u2019t an option for me.

Good/Modern UI - What I found most surprising in my search is that most of the available software have a UI that is practically the same and it looks like all of them are stuck with their default UI for the last 7-8 years (if you are a regular on vBulletin-powered forums you would know what I mean). It is possible that there may be some custom themes that provide a UI that look stylish in which case I would like to know about them too.

Hosting - F/OSS is desirable since I would like to know what goes on inside but I am not particular. \nHowever, I need to be able to host the site on hosting providers of my choice.

Social networking - Profiles/friend-ing(for lack of a better word)/photos/likes etc. would be nice purely in the interest of building relationships between users but it is not a core feature. Voting on stories/topics ala HN is not necessary.<p>5. Tech support - I should be able to jump in and resolve most technical issues but I would rather focus on managing/growing the community, so I would like to see some decent support for troubleshooting issues.<p>Even if you do not know specifically about the software, I would appreciate if you can point me to some well-designed forum sites that you personally like.", "date": "2011-08-09"}, {"title": "Ask HN: Critique/review my first app, Milestone", "URL": "", "text": "Around this time last year, I built my first app for Windows Phone.

The idea was to provide a \"new look\" that would help to \"quickly scan the store and find interesting things to try out\" [1].<p>Although the new look is indeed more \"catchy\", there are (in my opinion) important issues that should be fixed or at least highlighted.<p>= 1) Search | I don't know if you tried recently to search for something in the new webstore, but results tend to be very irrelevant.<p>For instance, let's search for \"Gmail\" [2]. Results will display apps and extensions all together and more importantly results that do have nothing to do with the original query, e.g \"Angry Birds\", \"Plants vs Zombies\", \"Turn Off the Lights\". Clearly, the algorithm puts largely too much weight on the popularity or the number of users of an extension/app.<p>Now, let's be more precise, and let's search for \"ad remover gmail\" [3] - short story, I developed an extension for Gmail called \"Ad Remover and Better UI for Gmail\". Here, again the first result is irrelevant \"MusicSig vkontakte\"!! Why the latter extension appears in first position: (i) popular (&#62;100'000 users) (ii)the words \"removing ads\" appear in its description. So, the new webstore algorithm seems to parse and take into account more than before the description of addons and extensions. Again, the weight of the parameter \"description\" should be far less than the one put on the \"name\" of the extension/app to avoid this kind of issues.<p>= 2) Navigation | The new first page uses tiles to present extensions/apps to the user. Basic information available at first glance are the name of the app/extension and number of stars. While it's good to attach the [1-5] stars-scale to indicate the \"quality\" of an extension/app, this measure seems a bit incomplete without indicating the number of users the extension/app has.<p>= 3) Screenshots | When you publish an extension in the new webstore, you must provide screenshots with a size of 1280x800 px. This size is pretty big and not very understandable, especially when you see that those screenshots are resized to half, ie 640x400px [4].

I bid more than the other bidders but got the contract because of my experience with the math the project uses.<p>It took 2 weeks just to make the mockup, because they had me endlessly doing GUI tweaks instead of core back-end work.  There was a steep learning curve for iOS because Apple UI widgets sometimes work in custom ways that break expectations.  I spent many more days in stack overflow than expected.  I fully accept responsibility for underestimating the mockup phase of the project.<p>However, it's becoming clear that I may not be able to finish this project.  There is a language barrier which is hindering my ability to communicate my experience, so they not interested in my design advice.  I'm torn between doing what they want and doing it well, because I'm having trouble with the idea of putting my name on work I don't believe in.<p>There is also a financial barrier.  I've already donated a week of my labor and simply can't afford to continue.  So far I've received 1/4 of the total as an up-front payment.

Is it worth transferring, what are my chances, I think I might have been able to fair better.<p>I'm an incoming cs freshmen at UIUC. UIUC was a bit of a safety for me (though in hindsight maybe it should've been a safety/target). My feelings about going there are really sort of mixed, for various reasons, and I'm, very idly at this point, considering possibly transferring to a different school.<p>1. Should I even bother? I'm very serious and passionate about going into CS - from what little I've seen of the school so far I'm fond of its overall student community and the CS community - the very fact that there is a noticeable CS community is something that's important to me, and part of why I picked UIUC over my other main option, NYU. Anyway, my point is that there are few schools that beat UIUC in CS anyway. In my mind, the places that are better than it for undergrad cs are MIT, Stanford, probably CMU, and possibly Berkeley - I think UIUC is better or at least on par with any other CS department, and none of the ones close to UIUC have other qualities (eg, being a better overall school) that would make me want to transfer there. So, given that those are my choices, should I bother transferring? I hear MIT and Stanford have very very low transfer accept rates. CMU and Berkeley seemed a bit more promising, but the figure I saw for CMU was overall, not for SCS, and I think I heard somewhere that Berkeley only accepts junior transfers. Are any of those departments better by enough to make it worth disrupting my time at UIUC and readjusting to a new place?<p>I have anecdotal bias against this: my dad had been rejected from Wharton as a high school senior and went to NYU. He was pretty happy there, had pretty good grades, liked the people, but he still wanted to try for Wharton and got in as a transfer. He then hated it at Wharton - it took him 5 years to graduate, his grades were pretty bad, and he couldn't get any jobs. He says he would've been much better off going to NYU, which was at the time pretty far behind Wharton for economics and business, what he was interested in. So I don't want this to happen to me - I don't want to leave somewhere I may be perfectly happy at and doing well in for a \"better\" school where I'll end up doing worse for unforeseen reasons.<p>2. What are my chances, at any of the places I mentioned (MIT, Stanford, CMU, Berkeley)? My junior GPA was a 3.933 - it's probably going to drop a bit from my senior year grades, but hopefully not too much. SAT was a 2270 (super score from 2 tests - 690r, 780m, 800w). If I begin to seriously consider transferring I'd probably retake them and actually study this time. SAT II math2c was an 800, chem was a 680 (I'll probably retake, and study this time). My ECs were okay, not terrific, hopefully I'll have some research or an internship at UIUC to talk about.<p>As far as how I faired this year: my two main choices were MIT and CMU - I got rejected at MIT and waitlisted at CMU (I know some people from this year and last who were about as or possibly less qualified than me who got in to SCS at CMU, but they had applied ED - I applied regular decision). I also applied to Princeton, Columbia, and Cornell kind of randomly (ie, without having shown any kind of interest in them) - got rejected from them. Like I mentioned, I also got in to NYU, and also to Rutgers. I had also applied to UMich and got wait listed, though I'd say that was probably because I applied right on the deadline and also had shown no interest - a friend of mine who did get into UMich (and had applied earlier) got flat out rejected from CMU (while I got wait-listed).

Well, maybe they only wanted to take one person from our school\" (which wasn't the case, but anyway). Another friend (the one who got in to CMU), also told me (after I had heard from my schools) that he had been sure I'd get into MIT.

Even though I don't have a degree and am largely self-taught, I doubled my salary at that job within 2 years, converted my workplace to Macs, and established the company's mobile development practice, becoming the lead mobile developer.<p>Our main product was a web CMS which we used to build custom sites and apps for people. In this process, there's a designer, and the designer must produce a design (which dictates aspects of the resultant software) according to his/her understanding of the client's needs as well as his/her amount of knowledge about computer systems. The developer then generally has to take this design and attempt to convert it into real software. Unless the designer is one of the rare people who is also an engineer, and unless this process is set up in such a way as to give the developer a high degree of input into the design, then the resultant software probably will never reach its full potential. The UI may not take full advantage of the tech, or the tech has to be redesigned or shoehorned into the client or designer spec. It's an altogether suboptimal approach to what should be a smooth and well understood process.<p>We've seen this kind of thing happen before. In the period of time before companies like Adobe and Apple ushered in the age of desktop publishing, the artist who designed something for print and those who produced/implemented it were entirely separate. The artist could of course produce copies of his work but usually it took lots of time and resources. When we got desktop publishing the game changed. Nowadays, instead of real canvases, paintbrushes, and pencils, we use tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, and printers to produce high quality work.<p>Right now we are experiencing a huge shift from print and web publishing to mobile and web publishing. And the problems in the process of producing mobile apps and publications indicate a huge missing piece in the puzzle.<p>There are some solutions to these problems. But where I worked, even in my position, nobody wanted to listen to me. I got fed up, and after using a few weeks to validate these solutions, despite my high paying job but lack of long term savings, I quit my job in November 2011.

Chrome also seems to treat the dragEnter events strangely, making nested element hover handling difficult.<p>We could potentially implement a custom solution (the front-end is React, so it wouldn&#x27;t be too hard) but that also seems excessive.<p>I&#x27;m about to add a dependency on jQuery and jQuery UI just to allow the use of their bulletproof Draggable and Droppable elements.

There were good and bad times in regard to work&#x2F;life balance, money, clients and myself. I am not a famous rockstar freelancer, but during recent 2 years I have been earning $7-$10k per month average, making my clients quite happy and being able to support my wife and our two children. Before starting freelancing I had been working for 8 years at a local publishing house where I got from an ordinary designer to a head of IT dept serving 20+ daily&#x2F;monthly editions.<p>Now I feel like I am ready to perform a next step in my life, in regard to my career. Recently I have received a job offer from a company in Stockholm doing a software as a service, for a position of a frontend developer. I had a talk via Skype with a couple of representatives of the company and in the end they offered me to visit their office to have a detailed talk as they seem to be quite content with skill I have shown so far. Surely they offer benefits, work permit visa and other things like a vacation, insurance.<p>I googled for average salaries for a position like mine there in Stockholm as well as in other Sweden cities. I have also found some more info about life there, costs, conditions, climate and so on. I know &#x27;average salary&#x27; doesn&#x27;t give much info about my specific potential salary I can get there. But at least I see the range and it&#x27;s quite different from my current income knowing that I will have to pay for an apartment, likely pay more for food and other things I don&#x27;t yet know about. On the other hand, may be it will be a good start for me to go networking, finding new opportunities, improving my skills.<p>So, please advise, what things I should consider while deciding? Did you face similar choice when you were offered with a job while you were freelancing? How did you choose to accept or to reject a full time job? What are important factors for you? Can it be a real move forward or more like a deadlock turning me into a small gear in a big mechanism?

Here are some of your argumets. I try coming with some answers.<p>1) \"To me, free is the freedom to use whatever I want, including propertiary software.\"<p>In this context, when we talk about 'Freedom', we mean 'Free Software'. Fortunately, Richard Stallman, they guy you are bashing about, defined the term 'free software'.<p>Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program for any purpose.<p>Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.<p>Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.<p>Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.<p>This is what 'Free Software' means. Please, feel free to use any propertiary software you want. But please dont try changing or misusing the 'Free Software' term. This is the software freedom rms talks about. When arguing about 'Free Software' you dont have the right to change the meaning of term for the sake of argument.<p>2) \"Richard Stallman is crazy. We should replace him with someone more practical.\"<p>Free Software Foundation is an ideologic campaign. Its not a Software Project. Its not there to create a fancy UI for your desktop. Its there to pusht the concept of 'Software Freedom'.\n\tFSF doesnt care about quality of software. Their priority is freedom.<p>GNU project, on the other hand, is a software project. It includes many many software projects, created by hundreds of programmers around the world. You probably have emacs, gcc and gnu coreutils on one of your devices. These are written by rms. He has doe more. Way more.<p>He puts his work where his mouth his. He has done some high-profile work. He IS a practical person.<p>GNU project is a software project. Richard Stallman created it. Created emacs, gnu coreutils, gcc and many other projects on it. He has done A LOT on his 'practical' side of efforts.<p>FSF should NOT be run by people who would give up a penny on software freedom for practical reasons. Because insisting on software freedom is its mission.<p>3) \"Richard Stallman is politically incorrect.\"\n\tYes he is. That is the way he is. Like it or not.\n Respect his individuality. Not everyone should be 'politically corect'.\n\tHowever, that doesnt mean he is 'wrong'. Most of the times, he is a very harsh guy making very valid points.<p>4) \"rms should 'step down'.\"\n\trms should step down as what? As the leader of Free Software `movement`? Well, there is no official 'leader' on this movement. Its just that people value his words ad his work. And he earned it.<p>Now, you say he should step down as the president of Free Software Foundation? Why? He is the founder of FSF. He drives it the way he wants. If you (or anyone else) think you could do a better job of pushing free software through an organization, GO DO IT. Free Software Foundation is not the 'exclusive' supporter of Free Software.<p>(There are already other orgaizations like FSFE)<p>Now, enough defending rms. I dont think he needs me or anyone else to 'defend' him. As a matter of fact, I bet he would argue me about many things I write here.<p>Lets talk about you this time.<p>Most of you are the people who use propertiary software. Even develop (or dont mind developing) and selling propertiary software and its 100% ok to you. You use Macs and iPhones because they have a litte bit fancier user interfaces. You praise Apple because its products are 'slick'. You would immediately choose a propertiary software if its technicaly 'a little bit' ahead.<p>You occasionally drop a few hundred lines of code on github and then think you are a contributor to Free Software? No.\nYour reasons for sharing that piece of software is usually very 'Open Source'. You do it because you want a good resume. You do it because it gets you credit and karma. You do it because its fancy. Most of you dont do it because of Free Software. You dont actually care about Free Software.<p>Disclaimer: Im among you. Im not like rms either.

When I used Periscope - everything was just where I thought it should be, nothing felt out of place and all the icons did what I thought they should do.

This was due to the UX of&#x2F;on Periscope.<p>Second and most drastic thing:\nMeerkat should totally get off the Twitter grid. Make the app a standalone app and quickly get to Android (Kudos to them for the recent talks of expanding to the Android ecosystem). A move to Android and going solo&#x2F;off the grid would open them up to a wider audience - with this approach they&#x27;ll win!<p>* I only wish Twitter would now change the name of Periscope to something sexy; something that rolls a lot easier off the tongue and sounds better to say than Periscope.", "date": "2015-04-17"}, {"title": "BookBugs is hiring a VP for Tech \u2013 be part of our early growth and social impact", "URL": "", "text": "Socially Conscious EdTech Startup Seeking Vice President of Technology (Full Stack)\nBookBugs | www.bookbugs.net<p>BookBugs is an online children\u2019s bookseller with a social mission \u2013 for every three books we sell, we donate one to a child in need.

Investors don't put that in out of the goodness of their hearts and one wonders how long they will wait to get it back.<p>When you hear of companies like this supposedly being sold to VMware, which didn't happen it, and at least one of the founders jumping ship, sorry, leaving, it has all the hallmarks of investors wanting to cash out. My opinion hardened further when I saw EY stopping you from using single instances for single servers, you have to use the medium instances now. No micro instances either. They're trying to seemingly expand into PHP hosting as well. I stopped using them when it became clear it was going to take them forever to get EU and Postgres support, which they now finally have. I had a rep from them 'reach out' to me literally every five minutes and I asked him over and over when this stuff would be ready.<p>On to Heroku, and the great thing about them is that it's very easy and fast to start running an application, and very cheap if it's small and useless. The downsides? It gets expensive very quickly and you are very limited with the applications you can run. Really? You're going to charge me all that money for me to squeeze my app into a read-only filesystem, extra for background jobs, no Varnish(?!), regimented software and no MySQL (not that I like it)? Then there's the add-ons............. Again, it's still only a platform built on EC2, so was it really worth the $212 million Salesforce.com paid? Their investors cashed out, and they only invested $13 million, I think, which I think is still way too much. Don't expect any price decreases any time soon, certainly not with SFDC.<p>It could just be cynical me, but I just think that these platforms built on top of IaaS environments like Amazon are very overvalued, expensive as a result for what they actually are and are focusing on the wrong things. What I'd be looking for is a cross between Heroku and EY with some really useful services such as proper monitoring, done on a budget without any financial silliness that acts like an elephant on its back.

Please keep the equations as general as possible, allowing for different density gases, voltages, capacitor sizes etc..<p>Design Description:\nA solid conducting sphere is placed within a larger hollow conducting sphere. It is suspended in the center of the larger sphere by a thin conducting rod. Both spheres and the rod are coated with a very good insulator. A charged gas is used to fill the space between the two spheres (for example H+ gas molecules). Since the gas is charged and like charges repel the gas will tend to stay towards the outer edge of the sphere.<p>Charging consists of connecting the capacitors terminals to a voltage source. Electrons will flow into the smaller, inner sphere and out of the larger outer sphere. As a negative charge builds on the inner sphere the H+ ions become attracted towards the center and compressed.  The more charge that builds on the inner sphere the more the gas becomes compressed and the more energy is stored in the electric fields.<p>Alternative designs\nThere are countless alternative designs.

This firm has raised somewhere in the low 8-digits for their first fund. More funds may be raised in the future.<p>The offer is salary/bonus + carry equity + benefits. The salary is significantly lower than what I'd earn as a consultant, but the low number is primarily a result of the low administrative fees for a new fund. As the firm grows, presumably my compensation would grow with it. Obviously the more good deals I help source or vet, the better chances of success.<p>My dilemma is partly about money, but mostly about the major career shift. Being a VC is not like starting a startup; it's more a finance job than an engineering one. That said, the two new YC hires are evidence of a trend I'm seeing of good engineers becoming VCs, having technical knowledge on staff instead of just MBAs and former execs. I'm just worried that I'm making a switch away from engineering and in doing so will let my skills atrophy to where they're no longer marketable.<p>HN, what say you?

The two most common restrictions I've seen when applying to incubators are:<p>Chances are low if you're applying as a single founder.<p>Chances are low if you're applying as a non-coding founder.<p>I happen to fall into the worst part of that hypothetical Venn diagram. The catch is that the app that I'm working on was selected as a Staff Pick in the Android Market back in January. I'm not saying it's perfect (there's still a ton of work to be done) but it shows that it's possible to have success as a noncoding, single founder.<p>So, why is there such an emphasis on having a coding founder? Since I'm not a coder, I hired a great offshore team to develop the code based on my UI designs, process flows and logic, wireframes, an excel spreadsheet of the algorithms, and database requirements. It's worth noting that I didn't throw piles of money at my team, in fact the first version, the one that was selected as a staff pick, cost me $300 to develop the code. So why is this approach looked down upon by incubators?<p>I implement SAP for a living, and this style of work is done quite often. For example, much of the technical team is offshore while the functional team works onsite. So why are startups penalized for taking this same approach when applying to incubators? I'd argue that the ability to quickly scale your team based on current project scope is a very potent tool, which outweighs the argument that because of the time constraints of an incubator you have to have a code friendly cofounder to churn out code.<p>Just something I've been thinking about, I'm curious to hear what everyone else has to say.

You visit the stream page, and you may broadcast messages to other users within a 5 mile radius of you. Messages are transmitted to other users in real time. Messages are also indexed with their geographical location, basically creating a geo-tagged message board where the message threads are real world locations (this enables non real time communication).<p>I'm going for a non room-based approach because I feel like that hampers the utility of this, and ultimately my vision is closer to CB radio than it is to IRC.

I've practiced SEO tactics, built backlinks, joined with affiliate sites with the same niche.  However, on this mission I there is one thing in particular I had a problem with finding \"the right one\" and resulted in me choosing to cancel and go with a different decision quite a few times.<p>What is this you ask? The web hosting! You can have the best html built, custom coded, SEO friedly website in the WORLD, but without good hosting services then your website is merely nothing! This is very true, as when it comes down to it, EVERYTHING depends on your hosting provider and its services.<p>Think of your hosting provider as the \"Heart\" of your website, and your files, folders, ect as the websites \"skeletol system\". Without the heart beating the bones, muslce, and even brain cannot function correctly! Poor or bad hosting services with your great website could lose you hundreds if not thousands of potential customers! When a guests visits your website he/she is NOT going to want to sit around for 2-3 minutes for EACH page to load! Eventually the potential customer will get frustrated and leave. This goes for poor uptime as well, if a member returns and see's that the websites hosting is completely down, thus making all of its content unaccessible! You will QUICKLY lose alot of traffic, trust me i learner FIRST HAND!<p>After trial and error several times, and even loosing money from a few crooked websites who promised refunds but did not fulfil their promise!(be careful) I finally stumbled upon a type of hosting company I had never heard of. \nThe words \"HostxPros\" with the subtitle, \"Professional Offshore Web Hosting\". I did some research, found only a few reviews that weren't bad. I decided to check out the prices next, and to my huge surprise the prices were very cheap! Baffled by the prices i decided to do some research on this so called \"Offshore Web Hosting\". From what I was able to come up with, Offshore Web Hosting is simply hosting servers which are located  offshore(obviously), where laws permit a few more laws  as far as \"whats allowed\" on your website.<p>Don't freak out, it doesnt allow anything out of the ordinary from the web or bad in anyway. I have found out that the MAIN reason websites use offshore web hosting services is because the prices are way CHEAPER and it allows forums owners to make forums that use a technique called \"warez linking\" This is where forum owners make forums based on members posting \"warez LINKS\" to other places where they can download warez or what not. Although they allow the linking of warez, offshore it is still illegal to directly host warez on any web server and or website(Just like the USA).<p>I conclude this article with this: \nIf your looking for CHEAP but very reliable hosting services to fit into your budget, then offshore web hosting is a great service to go with. I found that a majority of BIG , KNOWN, websites use offshore hosting not for the permitted laws, but simply for the outstsanding services at such a cheap rate. I guess its the conversion rate, or our money may be worth more in some offshore locations where these hosting companies are!<p>If you need recommendation : I currently host all my websites now on a very nice offshore server with 99.9% uptime and great 24/7 customer support to members AND non members :)!\nhttp://www.hostxpros.com", "date": "2011-05-03"}, {"title": "Looking for an I.T partner", "URL": "", "text": "I am looking for an I.T partner skilled in Facebook application development and it's API to replace the UI and update and tidy up the the code.

When I was slightly younger (and quite a bit more stupid) I would have conjured up some inspired sophistry to explain away my mistakes, or I would have tried to blame my lousy circumstances on someone else, but I'm past that kind of nonsense now. I'm old enough to know better. Not too old, though. I'm three years younger than Jack Dorsey and three years older than Mark Zuckerberg, so I think I'm sitting in a cultural sweet spot. I'm wise enough to accept that don't know everything, but experienced enough to trust myself when it counts. I'm confident in my judgment and abilities, but not to the point of arrogance and closed-mindedness. I've read that fools surround themselves with idiots so that they will feel superiority, but the clever surround themselves with the wise so that they gain wisdom. That's not a useless maxim if you ask me.<p>Paul Graham said: \"So who should start a startup? Someone who is a good hacker, between about 23 and 38, and who wants to solve the money problem in one shot instead of getting paid gradually over a conventional working life.\"<p>That's me. Of course, there are a million people who fit that description. Who am I kidding? Probably a few million...<p>So why me? Why am I worth someone's time and resources? Great question. Let's start at the beginning.<p>As I led with, I probably don't look very good on paper. Based on what the \"paper\" trail says, I come off as a bad bet. I owe some personal debts, my credit isn't exactly superb, and there are a few other little complications I'll be happy to elaborate on if your curiosity can't contain itself by the time you finish reading this message in a bottle.<p>Where were we? Oh yes, I'm a bad bet. Not a confidence inspiring statement, I'm aware, so let's fix that.<p>Seabiscuit was a bad bet, too, and that's me... I'm Seabiscuit. One day I'm limping along looking pathetic and broken and you think I'll never walk again, much less race. Yet, here I am, running... fast.<p>I've made some less-than-stellar choices in the past, but I've learned incredibly valuable lessons from those mistakes. They were always born out of emotion, confusion, or desperation; never out of malice, spite, or envy. They unexceptionally occurred whenever I was following my heart instead of my head, as I was always encouraged to do as a child. I've learned that I need to take more precise and calculated risks and follow my intuition rather than take wild risks and follow my desire. That's all very vague and ambiguous, I know, but it's important for me to convey that I am somewhat self-actualized in that regard. I'm at peace with where I stand and I am a forward-thinking person; it's an important characteristic of who I've become and who I intend to continue being.<p>Most of my issues were always self-induced, such as quitting jobs that I couldn't stand even when it wasn't a financially stable thing to do, or spiraling out of control when a relationship would end and then relinquishing any shared assets, bank accounts, vehicle, etc, or running away from home as a teenager. I would always respond to situations without proper emotional intelligence, a skill I've acquired and begun to master in recent years. I've also developed an incredibly humanistic and empathetic side as my emotions have matured.<p>My repeated and intentional detachment from material possessions coupled with my inability to submit to the complacency of \"the norm\" and a regular job has only fueled my creative and entrepreneurial spirits. I don't have a burning desire to fill my pockets with dollar bills, but a fire does rage inside to build a successful business and to, as Paul Graham put it, \"solve the money problem\". Which brings us to ambition and motivation...<p>Why do I want financial flexibility? Why do I need money if I don't care about things? Why am I writing this? Why am I driven? How driven am I?<p>Good questions.<p>I want to enjoy my life. I want to help others. I want to do something with my life, something positive. I want to leave something in the world that wasn't here when I arrived. I want to contribute and make a difference. I want to do something that matters.<p>I have a family (not a wife and kids or anything, but immediate family, parents, sisters, brother, nieces and nephews) who really need some help and breaks in their lives. I've done all I can to help them at every turn, given my parents money that I simply did not have, given up my rent to help them keep food on the table and pay heating bills, etc. I've supported them as much as I can when I've been thriving, but I've always been torn between keeping a job that destroys my soul just to provide some help vs. trying to succeed on a larger scale and making things easier in the long run rather than day-to-day. I won't go into the details of my various family concerns (health problems and bills, lack of economic opportunities, etc) but I have more than enough reasons to push myself to the limit. It consumes me that they are not taken care of and that they struggle the way that they do. I <i>must</i> help. I know now that what I need to do is live as close to the metal as I can for now and put off helping them as much as I can until I am financially secure. This means building my company and resolving my personal financial issues so that I can focus on my work without financial stress and distractions.<p>I have a tremendous work ethic that I wish could be applied to something I really care about.<p>I am tired of worrying about how I will survive and how I will make enough money to take care of everything and still find time to work on my businesses. I want to know that what I'm supposed to be focusing on <i>is</i> my business.<p>My biggest downfall in pursuit of that goal has been that I've never really tried wholeheartedly at anything worth doing. I don't mean that I haven't put enormous amounts effort into things, because I've definitely done that (studying, learning, programming, art, music, reading, preparing myself, etc), but I've never before had something that I cared so much about that I actually wanted to (or have been able to) devote all of my time to making it grow and succeed. I've <i>wanted</i> to have something that I was that passionate about, but I always found myself busy working on someone else's project or at someone else's company, usually doing something that disagreed with my personal philosophies and tastes. I'd quickly burn out and become uninspired and leave behind the mind-killer to go dive into my own creative development (music, writing, code, etc). I've had ideas, companies, little startups here and there, but nothing I ever had the time and resources to really make succeed. I've never been able to find someone who can get as excited as I can about something and then believe enough in it to actually follow through and manifest the idea. I finally have that now. I need to be able to build upon my existing product and I need to be able to get good people involved.<p>I very recently ended a 5-year relationship and for the first time have had an appropriate emotional response to the situation. I've focused on my work, my clients, my own companies, my networks and relationships and the outcome has been very positive. I am now completely free of being tied down to a particular place and I am no longer subject to normal relationship distractions. ALL OF MY TIME CAN FINALLY BE DEDICATED TO MY COMPANY AND I AM READY TO DO THAT. I CAN FOCUS COMPLETELY ON BUILDING A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS AND AM VERY MOTIVATED TO DO SO! I have so much built up passion ready to let loose it is unreal. I am ready to pour myself into this.<p>I have a myriad of clients that I consult and develop for (government and commercial), I am part of a great open source development team, I have two startups of my own, and was just offered the CTO and lead developer position at a funded startup that is building a mobile gaming platform. I want to work on my own projects, but some of the other opportunities are making it too lucrative not to consider them. If I go that route I will be falling right back into working on someone else's dream instead of mine. I don't want to do that again.<p>I have been an entrepreneur for as long as I can remember. I started on my first paper route when I was 10 years old. I woke up at 3 a.m. every day before school and on the weekends to stuff and wrap over 200 newspapers to deliver all over the small midwestern town I grew up in. I delivered newspapers before and after school for 5 years, through all kinds of weather, reading the newspaper every day as I delivered it. I was responsible for purchasing newspapers from the publishers, collecting payments from my customers, and handling the financial balancing act. There was once a contest to sell newspaper subscriptions all over the area that I lived in. The winner was awarded a $200 gift certificate to the a mall in addition to being entered into the \"Newspaper Carrier Of The Year\" competition. I sold 200+ subscriptions all over the region and won the contest.<p>In high school I started my first web company with two other students while I was already working at a web consulting firm as a developer after school and on the weekends and also at the technology services center for the school district I attended.<p>After high school I moved to California and joined as the CTO of a startup hosting company that also gave me equity, but because of a bad business deal and trusting the wrong friend I didn't receive any financial payout when the company was sold. Lesson learned about people, business, money, and contracts.<p>After that experience I bounced around a few companies, usually clashing with the people who ran the place because their goals never corresponded with mine. Most places I worked were stagnant and comfortable and inspired no ambition, drive, or loyalty. They were jobs. I am not a job person. They always lacked culture. I am a <i>work</i> person, just not a job person.<p>I caused a little trouble in my 20s, learned a lot of life lessons, opened my eyes and ears and started to grow up.<p>I've spent the last 3 and a half years building two companies, one on top of the other. One is a PAAS (Platform as a Service) and the other is a typical kind of startup (built on top of the PAAS), but it's the one I'm most excited about and have put the most effort into. It's fully developed far past prototype, has users, but is stealth-ish at the moment. I have an amazing network of people ready to help me and promote it and develop it further. I have a vision and high standards and want to do so much more with it than is already built but lack the resources. I keep seeing companies get ridiculous amounts of funding or being purchased for huge sums; I don't need anything close to those numbers! I don't know how some of these people can blow throughs o much money and have so little to show for it. It baffles me.<p>So... here I am.<p>I'd rather not spend my days making tedious changes to minutia at the request of clients and bosses. I'd rather do something interesting that inspires me to solves problems using creativity with a group of clever and awesome people.<p>I consult nearly full-time right now and spend my other waking hours working on my open source projects and my own companies, often skipping sleep. I want to spend much more time on my own stuff, but that's simply not possible when I have to worry about my financial situation and do work for others.<p>I don't want a mansion or a yacht, I just want to work on positive things, take care of my family, build more things, and make a difference.<p>I have my finger on the pulse of culture, business, industry, art, society, and a lot of other things. I read Hacker News and read and watch everything I possibly can that might give me helpful insights.<p>I keep seeing how being a risk taker with a mind of your own is a big plus for founders. Well, look no further. I saw what Peter Thiel said about \"Founder as Victim, Founder as God\".<p>I'm passionate, motivated, capable, aware, insightful, open-minded and eager.<p>I know the Silicon Valley names, I know who the big players are, who the go to guys are, but I'm not sure that's the game I want to play.<p>I own 100% of one of my startups and 50% of the other (the more exciting one). The other founder (non-technical) is open to a buyout, although I don't have the resources to do that myself. They are also willing to stay involved under the right circumstances. I'd prefer to run things completely autonomously, but I'm flexible. The other founder is willing to let me make all creative, technical, and financial decisions; they only want their ownership for now (unless I can buy them out). The company is incorporated in Delaware and is in good standing and is set up as a California foreign corporation. The company name / domain name is trademarked and the concept and execution are quite good. We've been offered a somewhat reasonable investment a couple of times, but I wasn't happy with the conditions. I completely believe in the idea, the execution, and the possibility of its success, now it's time for me to find someone else who does too.<p>Hopefully I will find someone who can appreciate that while I have a vision and a goal, I lack some of the more annoying pretenses. I don't feel entitled to anything.<p>If you want to know the specifics of my companies and have an interest in possibly getting involved with me in some capacity (even just to give me advice or ask questions) then respond to me and I'll send you the details. You can email me privately at angelheaded@yahoo.com (I created an account just for this)<p>I'll also send along a more detailed summary of my own skills and experience.<p>I'm not looking for someone who wants to see what my companies are and then go talk about them on the internet or something just yet, I'm looking for someone serious to get involved and provide what I need to help me continue to build something real and substantial that we can both benefit from.<p>For once in my life I would like to not have to worry so much about things that I care so little about.<p>Bet on Seabiscuit, he's going to win this race.

It all started with my frustration with trying to find anything worthwhile to watch on online streaming sources (Netflix, Amazon Prime etc). Once you run out of the mainstream movies to watch, you are pretty much destined to read one movie description after another without actually seeing a movie. So I thought, wouldn't it be cool if there is place where people can submit awesome non-mainstream movies available on various streaming sources and let the community discover/vote on it. That's the idea behind Onlify.com, a place to tag ('onlify') and share non-mainstream movies. Besides what I have out there on the site, I also want to add a few more things<p>1. Use gaming techniques to give people incentive to hunt down the nicest movies they have seen on various streaming sources. Points, unlockables, leader boards etc.\n2. Come up with a movie description language to help match a user's mood to a movie.

It\u2019s a social web application. Me and my co-founder are really good friends, we started working on this idea, just after college. We had couple of good offers to join, but we decided to do our own startup. We\u2019ve read all the essay's of PG, we have the hacker\u2019s attitude. We\u2019ve worked our asses off, we got one funding offer as well, but that was too low to do anything, we are based out of India. We\u2019ve all the latest technology stack, djang/jquery/orbited/apachemq and all. We\u2019ve learned a lot of things during these 10 months, I\u2019ve became a different person altogether, from a college kid to an entrepreneur, have came a long way.<p>Coding, testing, deploying, releasing, going to the crowd, iterating, we have learned this all. I\u2019ve worked upon everything, from django to UI/UX, making banners to videos, PR to marketing, support to sales, everything. It\u2019s been a wonderful life so far. I wouldn\u2019t have learned all these things, had it been a regular job after college. I am so grateful for myself and my co-founder for letting me work on all these, all these months.<p>It\u2019s been an emotional roller coaster ride too,    many many strange, weird, unimaginable things happened too. We started with very small amount in hand, it was the word decision among all others. Money started to become a problem of us. But we managed somehow.<p>The story has many twists as well, 3 months back, both of us lost our laptops, yes both of us. It was a painful time. It took us well two weeks to recover from that. We met with so called startup mentors of India, listened all the bad things one could listen, we iterated our product, pivoted again, but it\u2019s a social app, it takes time to take off. Especially, if you are in India ( nothing that I am complaining). We have all the patience an entrepreneur can have. We got covered in national newspapers as well, but nothing big has happened so far.<p>It\u2019s been 10 months. We have simplified our product, removed almost all features, we\u2019ve worked on the design, very hard, it\u2019s come out good now.<p>Lessons that we have learned is, social web app is a saturated market, you are compared with facebook, even if you don\u2019t want, everything can be done by making a facebook app or whatever and you need a lot of good people/networking into the tech world to really get them off the ground. We lack it.<p>Final words, we are not doing good. We are in good state of mind, have taken all the positive things from it, me and my co-founder has a great co-ordination, it\u2019s just that we didn\u2019t pick the right idea or we were too young then. Now, we are at the point that we want to take some decision, whether to move on, do something else or to stick on it for some more time.<p>Personally, I am thinking of working at a startup in SV.

I know it's not a huge amount but I am doing iOS app development on my free time to be up to date with the SDK, and get some passive income.

Numbers of download is following the same pattern and there is no particular reason for the pattern to change. The app is on small nice market that most likely not going away anytime soon. Sorry I can't be more specific about it.<p>The main advantage of selling the source code/domain is that most likely I will re-invest it by hiring some contractors / UI designer to get some other iOS app ideas off the ground.

It was the result of wondering how I can easily validate my assumptions about where to take my main project after we release it, as well as experience at another startup watching overly vocal users steer the product in a direction that's probably not where it should have gone.<p>It basically operates as follows: a single page is given to users, where they can order preferences in sets of 10, which are then merged into an overall ordering. Project owners have a page that shows them this popularity based ordering and some data about its accuracy.

It was my seed idea, but my contribution was on the design/UI end. We applied to YC fall 2010, and were rejected (rightfully so, in retrospect). My previous coding experience entails a bit of Fortran from undergrad research, and building a couple of simple websites (Frontpage even. o-O). Anyway, I had tons of energy for the project, but lamented not being able to contribute to coding, where it was badly needed. After that experience, I resolved to teach myself something, so I could at least build a MVP, and not depend on anyone else to launch it.<p>I\u2019ve been a redditor since near the beginning, and I\u2019ve been on HN for about a year now. I have many ideas for these types of community sites, and (unlike many who lament the clones) think there remains a lot of potential in this space. As a result, about three months ago, I got news.arc, put it on Linode, and started to try to figure things out. The results of my efforts to date are Hubski, a general site for thoughtful sharing and discussion.<p>A number of my ideas are for Hubski have been implemented, some are not. Here are some that are:<p>Tags: each submission can have a hashtag. These are organic, the submitters choose. You can click a tag, and it will sort out submissions with that tag.<p>Following: You can follow users. The submissions of these users go into your \u2018hubfeed\u2019, your personalized version of the site. You can also follow hashtags. Submissions with those tags are put into your hubfeed, regardless of the author.<p>Scoring and voting: Karma is a currency. When you vote up or down, it costs karma, which gets converted to clout. Clout cannot be spent. Everyday you get a small bit of karma. This daily portion increases as your clout and number of followers does.<p>Hubs: The stream of someone\u2019s submissions looks kind of like a blog. It may even more so over time if it seems to make sense from usage. I even imagine Hubski could be used as a blog eventually. I have more thoughts along those lines. I\u2019ve enabled image embedding, to see how it works. I\u2019m going to do the same for video.<p>There are a number of smaller changes as well, such as tabs (opens 2 tabs, the url and the comment page), hovertext (hover over a title while logged in), and some others.<p>I have much more planned, but from here on out I want to implement further changes to be a bit more informed by usage. Also, I am learning, so it takes extra time.<p>I know that this won\u2019t be my last app, (I have designs for a completely original one) but it\u2019s my plan to maintain and evolve Hubski going forward. I\u2019ve been using it with my wife and some good friends, and it is serving a need that I have.<p>BTW, I want to thank the folks in the Arc forum who have been really friendly and helpful to someone as green as myself.<p>Any feedback is greatly appreciated, especially if you can take the time to bounce around the site.

Both performed well, but PA performed better, and for less cost.<p>2) Clearer Billing Practices\nOne thing that frustrated me about AdRoll was their vague billing methods, especially when you are running multiple campaigns for multiple customers.  AdRoll would build up a \"reseve\" in our account, even though the campaigns weren't exhausting it.  Perfect Audience sends a very clear, detailed summary of the billing each week by campaign, showing what was used the prior week, and what they need to replenish the campaign to get it to the weekly amount.<p>3) Easier UI\nBoth systems have similar UI in terms of the setup, but PA is the winner here.  I like their UTM tag builder, and the way I can differentiate between clients in what I would call \"agency mode.\"<p>4) Receptive to Customers\nI thought that PA did a fantastic job of reaching out to customers and getting feedback.  I gave them a few ideas that seemed to get their interest, and I like dealing with companies who value my opinion.<p>As I said earlier, both systems are great platforms, but I prefer to use Perfect Audience for the reasons above.", "date": "2013-01-03"}, {"title": "Ask HN: Good iOS Tutorials?", "URL": "", "text": "I have started learning iOS app development from Apple's developer resources but those look like to be designed for a bit more smart audience.

My desktop PC, for instance. It's a great 6 months old working computer, with 8 cores and 16GB of RAM. \"This ought to be enough for all my needs\", I thought. The Bill Gates in me was right so far, but unfortunately this won't be enough for long.<p>Yesterday I took a look at my memory usage, out of curiosity: 11.4GB. Woah. I had a look at the breakdown.<p><pre><code>  - Chrome : ~3GB\n  - Firefox : ~1.5GB\n  - Java (eclipse) : ~1.2GB\n  - Rest in tons of various work-related apps.\n</code></pre>\nI'm of course responsible for letting this accumulate over several days, but still, a third of my RAM taken up by web browsing tabs? Chrome on its own clogging more than twice as much as Eclipse?<p>What worries me now is how hard we are getting struck with RAM-hogging web pages. Since I began writing this post, my freshly restarted Chrome browser with 9 open tabs (Hacker News (x2), Coding Horror, Google Search for \"Mac osX Lion review 6 months\", MoPub Ad Service monitoring, Google Analytics Visitors Overview, Android Developer Console, Twitter, Gmail) is taking up roughly 500MB of RAM. That's insane. On my 2010 Macbook Pro with 4GB of RAM, this means 20% of my overall caching capacity is taken up by my core web needs. Needless to say, I can't use my macbook anymore.<p>Last summer I was working on a little java experiment - a cross-platform 3D labyrinth. I wanted the overall memory and data footprint to be as low as possible so it could be played on a low-end android phone with really fast loading, and yet to keep the game space as big as I could, so I designed my own dedicated data structures overnight. I made the following calculation: over 500MB of raw, uncompressed data, I could store the description of an area roughly equivalent to a map of Europe with a resolution of 2.5 meters per pixel.<p>I'm not claiming any feat here, just stating the obvious: web programmers are doing something that's definitely not cool for our current RAM budget. We forgot any sense of measure. It's unnecessary for a twitter feed following 175 persons for an hour or so to claim a 70MB RAM footprint. You're not the only nor the worst offender, Twitter. Except that I had 26 new tweets to display, I clicked, and the footprint suddenly grew to 76MB. 26 tweets = 6MB. We're talking about 140 characters tweets, let's be generous and multiply that amount by 100 to take into account the tweeter's profile (which are all 10,000 characters essays as we all know), and we get a total of 364 000 new characters, which end up claiming more than 6 million bytes in RAM. Which means the RAM impact of adding 26 new tweets to a webpage is at very very least 10 times higher than it could be, and probably more like a thousand times too high.<p>Like I said, I'm only using Twitter to state a point. I mean nothing wrong with Twitter's web devs - actually I'm myself a very poor web developer - and I'm pretty sure the blame could also be put on Google Chrome instead, but I remember a day in 2002 where my Internet Explorer was trying to load a 4MB webpage from the hard drive, causing a RAM footprint above 40MB and a failure after 20 minutes of waiting in front of a white screen. Back then I was merely a junior consultant working on QA, and I was the one to tell the devs that they were definitely doing something <i>not cool at all</i> for the user's computer. True, we were showing rather complex and impressive amounts of \"data\" on our webapp with much simpler but oh so wrongly implemented \"UI\" (in that case, hundreds of unnecessary nested table anchors), but I can't help thinking back at those times where it was simply impossible to make a product that was <i>not cool</i> for the user's computer, because the computer would refuse to run it at all. We're way past this line today. My Twitter's tab has now garbage collected some data. It's back to 73MB ram footprint. There are 32 new tweets to show. I click them, and the footprint bumps back up to 78MB. Meanwhile, my overall Chrome footprint is now showing 550MB private memory. That's 50MB for two clicks on Twitter and ~4500 characters in a HackerNews' submit form.<p>Moore's Law nowadays affects the computing power requirements of software rather than the computing performance of hardware, and this is killing us.", "date": "2012-01-28"}, {"title": "Mapping human knowledge \u2013 analogic approach to make sense of reality (UX and UI)", "URL": "", "text": "Hello!\nFeedback time!<p>Please see below a seminal project I&#x27;ve been working at.\nI&#x27;d like to receive your feedback about:\n- applicability in markets (in this case, education + reference)\n- UI &#x2F; UX and the type of domains you&#x27;d like to explore\n- discuss about AI , machine learning and models adopted in neuroscience to mine semantic-trees for knowledge prediction.<p>This first thread (1&#x2F;3) is about feedback UX&#x2F;UI tailor to knowledge domains.<p>###<p>Atlas of Human knowledge\nhttp:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xdiscovery.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;atlas<p>A seminal project to use mindmaps of public knowledge to let anyone make sense of every topic, instantly.\nThe topology of mindmaps zips information about a subject, and allows manyfold UI to make sense of it.<p>###<p>Maps shown on the web page, are created with:\nhttp:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.xdiscovery.com&#x2F;<p>LearnDiscovery - mindmap of Wikipedia is a mobile tool I designed to access the mindmap computed from Wikipedia dump and save visual references.<p>Recommendations have been benchmarked VS Google&#x27;s Knowledge graph:\nrespect to Google approach, you get correlations for all topics, even the least popular (e.g. &quot;American Indian Wars&quot;, &quot;Dna&quot;, &quot;Machine Learning&quot; + you can traverse the whole domain...)<p>I see it as a milestone in education and reference: also novices can visually make sense of what smtg is about.<p>###<p>1.

I feel like it wants to be programming, but it isn't.<p>All right, so I've been working on a project to fix that for me. The project is called RCSS, meaning Ruby + CSS. As this isn't exactly my region of expertise, I'd love to hear some thoughts about the direction to take this.<p>The idea is that we can use a real programming language (I chose Ruby) to generate CSS animations for us.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to submit it before the thread was gone. I spent some time writing all of this down and wanted to share my experience as a user who migrated from iOS to Android. So here is the comment followed by my response. I hope I am not breaking any rules with this HN post - feel free to delete/downvote the thread if I did.<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3443202\n&#62; One thing I don't understand about all this talk of fragmentation: why does it matter? Should I care that some phones have three buttons and some have four? Should I care that screen resolutions vary? Should I care that the kindle fire doesn't have the stock android homescreen? What do any of these things matter? When I download an app, it works perfectly fine no matter what the platform specifics are. It's all android-compatible.<p>Compare the quality of iOS apps to Android apps.<p>Sure, there are examples on both ends of the spectrum for both platforms but my personal opinion is that the average quality of iOS apps is much higher than the current average for Android - a lot of this quality comes from a single device to test on and design for. Almost every app I tried for Android just felt like a html widget rendering some 'mobile' version of some site/service. The fun part is, most websites visited with safari on iOS felt like native apps - that's not the case with Android and device varieties is a strong factor here.<p>I used an iPhone for over 3 years (3g model) - I downloaded maybe around 90 apps during that time and bought ~40 in the same period. My highest purchase was probably around 20\u20ac and the average would hover around 5\u20ac. Most of the purchases were performed in the early phase of me owning the phone when I had a lot to pick from. Later on I bought as something new/interesting caught my attention.<p>It's not happening with Android. I'm using it for almost an year now. I did one, literally one purchase during that time and it was Minecraft Pocket Edition when it was on sale for less than 1\u20ac. Based on my example you could generally forget about Android users spending less on apps because of their financial/preference differences to iPhone users. Heck, my financial situation got significantly better during all this time but I don't see myself spending <i>any</i> money on the Android app store anytime soon.<p>It's just about the quality in my case. I literally use 2 apps that I consider of acceptable quality on Android - Opera Mobile and baconreader for reddit. Opera gained a lot from it's UI redesign they did after releasing the mini version to the iPhone, the previous iteration looked and behaved a lot like the default Android browser and that resulted with a large user slash back. Baconreader is simply the best reddit client available at this point for Android but it can't really compare to Alien Blue (imho of course). I saw no other apps of interest for me with acceptable quality.<p>Generally I am disappointed with the OS and the apps available for it. My iPhone stopped receiving updates after 2 years of usage? Not sure about the exact time span but I remember getting them much more often and for a longer period than the Samsung Galaxy S I am currently owning and guess what? Samsung recently announced that it will not be bringing ICS to this device - so it's either root the device or stick to older software even though the device is capable of running ICS.<p>I mentioned that the OS feels bad. I will point out one flaw for starters but will gladly provide more if this starts a discussion. So please tell me who was the genius that decided it's a good idea to unlock my phone if I answer a call using the headset button? I hate searching for the phone burried in my pocket during the winter...<p>To give you a better overview of my purchasing habit during iOS usage, here is the list of apps I paid for on it. I will skip the free ones and limit myself to just the ones I found installed on the device, most names are taken from their thumbnails and the fact that I 'paid' for them is from memory so sorry if an error sneaked in.<p>- AppSniper<p>- Prehistorik<p>- Deadly Dungeons<p>- Aqua Forest<p>- Assasin's Creed<p>- Doom<p>- Duke Nukem 3D<p>- Dungeon Hunter<p>- Dungeon Hunter 2<p>- AppBox Pro<p>- Mobile Mouse<p>- TouchTerm<p>- Scany<p>- 2Do<p>- iSSH<p>- iPharoh<p>- Wesnoth<p>- Alien Blue<p>- Rooms IRC client<p>- Rage<p>- Game Dev Story<p>- iDracula<p>- NightCamera<p>- TapTap revenge 3<p>- JotNot Pro<p>- Orions<p>- Doom Resurrection<p>- Space Monkey<p>- Worms<p>- Worms 2<p>- Samurai<p>- VLC Remote<p>- Zombie<p>- SoundHound<p>- SC2Casts<p>- Spore<p>- Wolf3d<p>This came out longer than I initially intended to and a bit more chaotic/rant like than I usually like to write.

A little background information:<p>Last semester before my stint as an intern at Videoplaza (hey guys!:D), I took up a course known as Software Engineering. Microsoft kinda sponsored the course. It was a 8 modular credit course, that meant an equivalent of 2 normal courses. That made this a huge course. The course scope was well, basically, for teams to put software engineering skills into practise. Iterative programmiing, revision control, software architectural design. You get the gist. The course requirement was for teams to engage software engineering skills to develop a file syncing tool, with C#.<p>Well, as a full time Archlinux user, I hated that I had to code a full app for a platform I don't even use. I was the leader of my team, and with a little bit of persuasion, I managed to convince my team to go with Mono, and to develop the app to work cross-platform. While everyone was working with WPF, .NET, blabla. My team did some crazy stuff like using SVN to sync files (instead of writing our own backend for syncing), GTK for GUI, iKVM to use SVNKit in Mono, blabla. It was a hell of a course, but we managed to pull through, and our plan to re-use open-sourced components meant we could focus on features, and learning new frameworks. Also, how cool would it be to go rogue on a Microsoft sponsored course?<p>My team won 2nd place when M$ came down to reviewed the apps after they were done. However, the team was awarded B+ as a grade, and myself, as a A+ only because my peers graded me highly on a peer review appraisal. It bothered me. The code wasn't that bad (review it at http://code.google.com/p/subsynct/), we met with some serious obstacles and overcome it anyways, and within a tight timeframe. I was proud of the result, and of my team's effort.<p>It made no sense to me how my team only deserved a B+.<p>And so after months of back-headed nagging, I shot an email to my professor for some clarifications: http://pastebin.com/APXEcFG4<p>Here is his reply: http://pastebin.com/paMntaY2<p>And heres my final reply: http://pastebin.com/DHSt1dkg<p>---<p>Just an example of how innovation is discouraged and frowned upon in an Asian context.

This took several months of nights and weekends (I still work full time) at which point I began seeking a freelance developer to build the product for me.  During my search, I couldn't stand not moving the project forward so I began teaching myself HTML and CSS, which I immediately fell in love with.  After a couple months of learning and practice, I was converting my Illustrator mockups into HTML and CSS markup.<p>I eventually found a local freelance developer and we started building the app in Rails.  I'm about 40 hours (and a few thousand dollars) into our work so far and have already learned an immense amount more about the development process.  I'm working with Git, Github, using Pivotal Tracker to break the project into stories and track progress, have gotten my feet wet with Heroku, have learned a little Ruby, and am starting to learn a little Javascript and jQuery.  I have tremendous respect for the development process and understand how much care has to be put into each decision when building an application such as this.<p>So what am I looking for?\n-Proficient in Ruby and Rails<p>-Work with HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, AJAX<p>-UI/UX proficiency a plus<p>-Preferably located in Portland, OR (at least initially)<p>I'm not looking for a code monkey. I'm looking for someone who will have a contributing voice for the direction of the product and the company.  Why would you want to work with me?  I'm a business guy, but I'm learning everything I can about the development process and understand the value of a developer's time.  I bust my ass to get what needs to be done, done, and if I don't know how to do something I will find a way and JFDI.  I can talk to anyone and have experience working with customers and doing deals.  I outperform people in my day job who have ten times the experience I have.  I can churn out copy, work the legal end, handle customer service, do graphic design and all the other \"business stuff\"; heck, I can even hammer out code alongside you through the night if that's what needs to be done.  I've already sacrificed almost a year of my mid-twenties and am prepared to sacrifice them all to pursue building this company.<p>What's the offer?  Since committing to become a technical cofounder is a huge decision for either of us, I'm offering a combination of cash and equity to start, with the opportunity to increase the equity stake if we turn out to be a good fit for each other (all of which are negotiable).  This helps mitigate the downside risk for both parties in case things don't work out.<p>Interested?  I'd love to grab a coffee or beer (your choice, my treat) if you're in the Portland area, or touch base via phone/email if you're not.

No one else shows you prices from Expedia, Orbitz, Priceline, etc. all at once.<p>3) We still kept our original hotel content and when available, you can filter by \"room view\" or by best value (free wifi, free breakfast, free parking, free shuttle).<p>4) Room Concierge - We think of it like Zappos meets the entire online hotel industry.  Usually, when you book online, you're treated as a second-class citizen.  The normal sites take your credit card and then they're done.  We're using our knowledge of the best rooms in hotels and providing everyone who books a 3-star or better hotel FREE concierge service to help fight for a better room on your behalf.  Want a QUIET room that doesn't sit across from an ice machine on the street level?  Just tell us and 48 hours before you get to the hotel, our team lets you know what we've been able to do for you at the hotel.  In our testing, 90%+ of the requests we make on behalf of our customers result in a room the customer wants.<p>5) This is a R77 Labs product, but try the free form search field out above the results.

Should I drop/hide the groups + messaging part of this service?

This year I had a couple of friends struggling with \"Intro to programming\" courses, and it made me reflect on what I was taught when going though a similar course at my own university.<p>My course, as well as the courses my friends were attending, were all trying to teach Java as a first language. There's nothing inherently wrong with learning Java (it's popular in big business, and that's where Universities are trying to aim their graduates) but something about the way that it's taught irks me.<p>I think that it's safe to say that Java is a fairly complex language. The JVM removes some annoyances that experienced programmers have had when trying to build a multi-platform systems, but it comes with a boiler-plate overhead. Most IDEs will deal with this automatically for you, so when you get to actually using the language, the boilerplate overhead isn't an issue. When you're learning not just the language, but the concepts of programming, then the boilerplate is horrible, scary, and confusing.<p>Now most programming courses will start with \"getting the JVM and (inevitably) NetBeans running\", followed by a quick trip down \"Hello, world!\" lane. Most teachers seem to think that the achievement of writing your first compiling program should be the thrill needed to spark further interest in programming, but in reality by this point they have taught students how to copy and paste. Some students will have managed to fail at that, too. And why? Because the boilerplate makes no sense to non-programmers. The fact that these nonsensical lines have to go in a specific order, and have to be typed in an exact way isn't always inherently obvious to a 'fresh-out-of-high-school, copy-down-notes' student. Crazy, I know.<p>The next problem will arise when some student who fool-heartedly assumed that they paid tuition so that they could be taught things dares to ask \"what does 'public static void main' mean?\"<p>The answer I got when I (yes, I was that fool-hearted student in my class) asked was the same answer related to me by both of my friends in their respective courses. \"Don't worry about that, just put it in. The program won't work without it.\"<p>That's not a good enough answer. You can't teach someone to program by telling them to ignore parts of the program (but to include them anyway or the magic won't work any more). What's more, if a student asks you a question about something, you shouldn't fob it off with a bit of \"you wouldn't understand\".<p>So point 1: I think Java is the wrong choice for a \"first language\". It has abstracted away problems that new programmers shouldn't be entirely ignorant of, and replaces them with confusing boiler-plate, and high-level concepts that really require previous programming knowledge to properly understand. Python, Ruby, Perl, JavaScript, or even, dare I say it, PHP would be better suited to the task because, as primarily \"scripting\" languages, they have the least overhead possible to doing something useful. Introduce the other concepts (objects, imports, abstraction, class inheritance, etc.) after you have gotten them comfortable with the basic constructs.<p>The next thing which bugged me when I was learning was this idea of \"We haven't reached that yet, so you can't use it\". I ran into it again when my friends asked me for help. They asked about simple problems which had common, well known solutions, that they weren't allowed to use because they hadn't reached that chapter yet.<p>I know that it's good to understand what a function does before you use it, and especially before you rely on it. I get that, I really do. But a big part of programming is research and discovery. Telling people, especially students, that they're not allowed to research solutions; that they must \"roll their own\" using only what they've already been told; that leads to home-made encryption, and poorly implemented variations of the standard libraries. That couldn't be further from productive. This is also made worse by 'learning libraries' (when I learned, we used one called 'BreezySwing' for all our GUI stuff) which aren't common standards, don't behave like the common standards, and can cripple a new programmer's understanding of some topics.<p>So point 2: Discouraging discovery, and worse, encouraging distrust in common standards (or at least teaching with non-standard libraries) just weakens the programmers. Instead they should be encouraged to find and research the 'best practice', and to understand how it works (stopping short of rebuilding it from scratch). I'm not saying that they should be taught to blindly trust other people's code, but they should be taught how to find and analyse existing solutions to a problem. It's all part of playing nicely with the programming community at large, and it takes a lot of time to re-train fresh-out-of-university programmers out of the idea that \"security through obscurity\" is a good thing, or that their half-remembered cryptography subject two years earlier puts them on par with the leading minds in the industry.<p>So that's my opinion. The way \"programming\" is taught needs an overhaul. I could probably pick out many more points, but they're the big two issues that I have with both how my university course was run, and how two other university courses (both at different universities to mine, and one is a different country) were also run. From this sample of three, and discussion with other people who have gone through similar courses, I'm left to assume that this method of teaching is pretty common.<p>So I ask you: How SHOULD we be teaching programming? What should an \"Introduction to programming\" course actually cover?", "date": "2011-12-27"}, {"title": "Ask HN: How does your support/sales/management inspect production DB data?", "URL": "", "text": "When you build a new product, there rarely is time to build rich internal websites to query production data and, in my experience, teams always resort to making scripts for the non-development part of the team, which are horrible to support (changes are hard to sync throughout the team, not everyone uses the terminal and so on) or they will hack some basic UI, which takes a significant amount of time and gets thrown away once there is a budget for something permanent.<p>I build an app called Pagehop (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pagehopapp.com) and I&#x27;m trying to figure out the demand of something I want to add, to remove the pain of the above-mentioned problem.

This way designers and copy editors could work in a CMS like they do with the old CMS solutions, but instead of it running server side, it would export all of the content to flattened HTML files. For the dynamic stuff it could be plugable so that the content is published to content files that can be picked up by ones favorite client side templating framework.<p>Further, it could be enhanced to support WYSIWYG editing for different widget toolkits, say Dojo's Dijit or jQuery UI, where front end developers could write a widget, add it to the CMS and then site editors could add it to a page, Think of Drupal but for pure JavaScript, HTML, CSS based apps.

I've recently ported my 2nd highest selling iPhone app to Android. Here is a comparison for the first 2 weeks of sales. If other iOS developers are out there that are thinking of porting to android, I hope this may be of help.<p>To keep things fair I'm only comparing one version of my paid iphone app to its android equivalent (Fantasy Football Monster '11). This does not include any ad revenue, in app purchases or iPad sales.<p>Date         Android  iPhone<p>Aug 25, 2011 $177.67  $420<p>Aug 24, 2011 $261.30  $382<p>Aug 23, 2011 $386.68  $386<p>Aug 22, 2011 $447.26  $425<p>Aug 21, 2011 $422.18  $585<p>Aug 20, 2011 $280.06  $403<p>Aug 19, 2011 $211.09  $352<p>Aug 18, 2011 $194.37  $388<p>Aug 17, 2011 $357.39  $342<p>Aug 16, 2011 $463.99  $330<p>Aug 15, 2011 $384.55  $407<p>Aug 14, 2011 $376.20  $483<p>Aug 13, 2011 $263.34  $502<p>Aug 12, 2011 $209.00  $508<p>Total            $4428.08 $5914<p>Per Day          $316.29  $422.43<p>So, overall the android version of my app makes about 75% of its iPhone equivalent. This is significantly better than I expected.<p>One more data point. The android app is currently about 250ish overall top paid, and the iPhone version is 350ish. Take from that what you will.<p>Some quick observations about android from an iOS developer's perspective:<p>1) I think developing <i>quality</i> apps is easier on iOS. I'm actually a Java/.NET developer by profession so I should naturally be biased toward Android. But once you get past the initial learning curve, I think that Cocoa Touch APIs get you 90% of the way there, whereas Android APIs get you about 30% of the way there. That is to say, if you want a lot of the nice UI touches you're used to on the iphone, you'll have to spend much more effort getting there on Android. The main advantage I feel Android has is memory management, but the reference counting method that Objective-C uses is second nature once you are familiar with the fundamentals.<p>2) Android gives you REAL TIME sales analysis. This is pretty incredible. Yes you can somewhat simulate this on iPhone using 3rd party analytics, but being able to see the moment someone bought your app just brings my obsession with checking sales and stats to another level. You also get your daily reports much sooner (about 12:30AM PST as opposed to 5-6AM PST).<p>3) Android market screws up orders quite a bit. In fact, almost 20% of all orders are declined or cancelled due to some android market error. After checking forums, it seems like this is not unusual. Now, I don't know if this means I have 20% lost sales, but still disturbing nonetheless. In android's defense, apple actually never gives you this level of detail. To my knowledge, you don't know if users can't buy your app due to an app store error. But judging from the fact that we get e-mails about this issue every other day on android and I've never gotten a single e-mail about this in the past 15 months I've been on the app store is very telling. Google has GOT to fix this. Developers lose, customers lose, and google loses.<p>In conclusion, I feel like the Android Market has really come into its own. The common wisdom that android owners do not pay for apps is demonstrably false. They may not pay as much per user for apps as iPhone owners, but the enormous marketshare Android commands is just too much to ignore.<p>I'll try to address any questions or comments in a timely manner, but I'm currently in Europe so please forgive me I don't get to all of them.

Conversation is done in the form of flat threads (currently) between as many people as desired (people can be added to conversations).<p>It's built on Redis and Python/Flask. Encryption is done using AES-256 and a custom PBKDF algorithm based on stretched Whirlpool, so it's exceptionally secure.<p>Without HTTPS enabled (to actually benchmark the script), it can perform about 1000 requests per second on my tiny server, but obviously it can scale, because of the back-end technology used.<p>Currently got a landing page set up at:<p>https://wire-bbs.org<p>But if anyone's interested in the code or contributing, check out the GitHub repository.<p>Screenshots:<p>https://wire-bbs.org/event_screen.png<p>https://wire-bbs.org/thread.png<p>https://wire-bbs.org/inbox.png<p>https://wire-bbs.org/create_event.png<p>Most of the feedback I've been getting is on the design, though what would be nice is the more experienced technical people advising me on some logistics and reviewing whether my security is sufficient (methods of encryption, key differentiation, etc).<p>Another idea I had was to be able to store messages purely in memcached, so if the server was shut off/restarted, any messages in memory would be lost.

I foolishly thought that the defense world built a lot of cool stuff, which I've since found is only true if you're an aeronautical engineer. The software is bog-standard in my limited experience. I'm working on a system that displays data onto a Google Earth globe from many feeds. When I was interviewing I was told that there would be substantial amounts of work coming up in Flex to replace a Swing based UI that is getting clunky and difficult to maintain. This excited me because I haven't got any Flex experience, and since my Java is pretty solid, I figured this would be a great chance to build the resume and add something more modern.<p>I found out recently that, not only is the Swing UI staying, but Flex development is not going to happen and the program is going into what's called \"operations and maintenance\" mode. There will be bug fixes and minor enhancements but no new development. The project is deemed \"finished\", and most of the good engineers who built it are moving on. Since I already know Java, and none of the work has been terribly difficult, I feel like I'm wasting my time. Due to the nature of defense work, I'm not even allowed to clean up other code unless it is directly connected to a specific bug record.<p>Within the company, I'm not allowed to transfer until I've been in my current role for two years, so if I stay here it looks like I'm stuck for a while with the dregs of the team who chose to stay behind and make time on this project. This, frankly, pisses me off, because it's a waste of time and talent that I feel I could put to greater use elsewhere. I stayed at my previous job for 4 years, and was in school before then, so I don't think I'm a job-hopper.<p>What's my best course of action at this point? Should I tell my manager that this isn't what I signed up for and ask for the transfer restriction to be ignored? Should I go get another offer (I have friends at Mapquest and Amazon who have both asked me for a resume) and explain to them why I left this company so soon?

Unhealthy thinking looking back in hindsight.<p>Right now, I work at a financial company working on the hardware and software for ATM machines. I study design and code for hours every day because some new ideas I have keep me up at night like when I first started on this path. I don&#x27;t want to go back to school and waste more time.

He knew that by writing the Noli Me Tangere and the El Filibuterismo thereby exposing the injustices committed by the civil and clerical officials would put his life and his family&#x27;s life in danger. He did not retract his writings because he was thinking not only of  the welfare of the present generations but also of the future generations.<p>Other said that it should not be Jose Rizal but should be Andres Bonifacio, because he was the one who lead a revolution to give the country its freedom and independence.  Bonifacio should have been the national hero because he wanted for an ultimate freedom for the Philippines and be separated from the authorities of Spain and that is through a revolution.<p>But through the novels of Rizal, Bonifacio and the other katipuneros were inspired. Rizal opened the minds of the people. At first, he  resented the revolution for he was not a revolutionary man and he did not want bloodshed. All he wanted was a reformation which the government did not grant. He gave his name and even his life for his  beloved homeland believing that through his death a new Philippines would be born with the youth as its leaders. If there is no Jose Rizal to influence  and give some courage, there&#x27;s no Bonifacio an other revolutionary leaders to fight for the country&#x27;s independence.

Sperm donated in this way is known as donor sperm.Sperm Banking is the collection,freezing (cryopreservation) and storage (cryobanking) of these healthy sperm for future use in reproduction. The sperm donated by the donor are inseminated into the female uterus to fertilize her eggs so that she conceives.In simpler words,the duty of a sperm bank is to gather,filter and dispense out the sperms.They can be just known as the middleman between the two parties, i.e. the donor and the patient.A man who wants to save sperm for future use,can do so by consulting a specialized sperm bank.One can freeze sperm for many years by storing them at -196\u00b0C in liquid nitrogen,after adding cryoprotectants to prevent the sperm from damage.<p>Sperm donation may be a treatment option for::<p>1. Single women.\n2. Men who have obstructive azoospermia or who have had vasectomy previously.\n3. Collection prior to IVF.\n4. Men who have had radiotherapy or chemotherapy or in whom testes have been removed    due to cancer/other disease.\n5. Genetic/Inheritable problems in the male partner.<p>Sperm banking will increase your chance of being able to father a child using your own sperm.Though sperm bank is mainly used for donor insemination,it is also beneficial to use sperm bank services in following circumstances.<p>1. When the husband is away (working overseas or traveling), his frozen sample can be    used to treat his wife.\n2. When a man is exposed to high risk professions with exposure to chemicals,    radiation, extreme heat, etc. it can cause sterility in men, so one can freeze      their sperm.\n3. When men is having variable sperm count, stored sperm can be used as a back up in    infertility treatment.\n4. When sperm are being retrieved surgically from the man (e.g. \u201cMESA\u201d, \u201cPESA\u201d or    \u201cTESE\u201d procedures).\n5. When the man is about to receive cancer treatment such as surgery, chemotherapy and    radiation which can cause permanent sterility and infertility.\n6. When the husband has situational erectile dysfunction and has difficulties    collecting semen by masturbation at the time of IUI or IVF cycle.<p>Sperm freezing enables the female partner to continue with her reproductive schedule. Human sperms are stored in case they are needed in the future to become a father. Sperm can be stored for as long as you want,even for many years.In the future this may be very important to you. Sperm banking will increase your chance of being able to father a child using your own sperm.Many young men who did not bank their sperm before treatment regret this decision.Later in life when they wanted to have children, they found out they were infertile.Many say they wish they had consulted specialist doctors to do this.<p>Some frequently asked questions regarding Sperm Banking.<p>Is it safe to use Sperm Bank?<p>Yes it is very safe to use sperm bank facility.Every sperm donor is screened for sexually transmitted diseases,as well as a slew of other diseases that might affect both the health of the mother and of the child.The sperm that you get from sperm banks is safe,and it\u2019s also of high quality in terms of the traits that the child will inherit.The entire fertilization process is also done by licensed and certified professionals.<p>How are the Semen Donors Tested? Are Donors Tested for AIDS? Is genetic testing done for the Donors?<p>The most thorough testing standards available are used.Sperm bank obtains Donor semen from carefully screened men who have undergone a rigorous medical examination,medical history and extensive testing to screen out any health problems.In accordance with established norms,all donors are tested for HIV 1 and 2,Hepatitis B and C and VDRL. Donors are screened for Thalessemia before entering the donor program.<p>What are the chances for Therapeutic Donor Insemination (TDI) success?<p>Realizing that each recipient is a unique individual with her own distinctive physical and emotional complexities, a probability of pregnancy of 40% within 3 cycles, and 75% within 7 cycles is estimated. 80% of the conceptions with Donor Semen occur within the first three cycles; 95% within six cycles. Certain biological factors  for which there is no control, directly influences the success or failure of the clinical procedures.<p>Whether the sperm donor should be known or unknown?<p>It is always advisable to go for unknown donor. If the donor is friend or relative then it may create social or legal problems later on. It becomes purely in the hands of the donor whether to keep the insemination process a secret or not.<p>Whether to use fresh or frozen semen sample?<p>Success rates with frozen semen sample is almost the same as with fresh semen sample. Recent studies have shown that if the frozen samples contain a sufficient number of motile sperm, pregnancy rates with fresh and frozen samples are comparable.<p>Fortunately, male factor infertility no longer means a couple must forgo the experience of pregnancy and childbirth. Thanks to modern reproductive technology and sperm banks, many of these couples have the option of becoming parents by using artificial insemination.<p>Rotunda Sperm Bank, is one of India's largest human sperm banks and is on par with any comparable International bank. It provides the most up-to-date genetic and infectious disease tested donor semen for infertile couples as well as freezing and storage services to patients desiring to have their own semen specimens preserved for future use. Prospective parents can choose the appropriate physical characteristics from the panel of donors so that skin color, height, eye and hair color can be matched. We also have collaboration with Cryos, the world\u2019s largest international network of sperm banks.

If your're not familiar with BTC, it's a digital, cryptographic currency which avoids central authorities and issuers (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin).<p>Bitcoins are currently being traded at Bitcoin exchanges, like MtGox and others. Because the phenomenon is relatively new, the exchange rates can fluctuate fast and heavily (e.g. from 13 USD to 30 USD over a couple of days, as happened in beginning of June). This creates a demand for rapid information, as traders need to make decisions based on accurate and valid information.<p>This demand has spawned the creation of a handful of Android applications and widgets for the Android platform, informing users of current BTC exchange index values. However, all of the available apps rely on polling for information. While this is easy to implement it requires the application to run in the background, or use of the Android AlarmManager API. This basically wakens the phone (Android devices enter a state called \"deep sleep\" to preserve battery power) e.g every 30 minutes, polls for the current BTC index, and presents it to the user. This approach is sub-optimal however, as it both drains battery and may present information which is up to 30 minutes delayed. The obvious approach is a true push-based approach, and for my weekend projcect, I made an app utilizing Google's \"Android Cloud 2 Device Messaging API\" (AC2DM or C2DM).<p>To test the Android application: https://market.android.com/details?id=no.skjervold<p>By removing the burden of polling a BTC exchange from the device and placing it on a third party server, a battery power consumption vs Information delay compromise was avoided. My web server can poll the exchange as often as I'd like (e.g every 10 seconds). I decided to go with the folling experimental and unusual software stack for my project:<p>-A web application using ASP.NET\n-HTML, JavaScript and CSS\n-DB4O for persistance (Object Oriented Database)\n-IIS (Internet Information Services) hosting environment\n-A thin Android client wrapping the web application<p>Since I was going to need a web server anyhow, I thought why not make the application a web application, presented inside a thin Android application? By making the real Android app very thin, I could place all business logic in the web app, allowing me to make updates and feature add-ons without re-deploying to Android Market, -instead I would simply re-deploy my web application. Additionally, I could design the UI using HTML, JavaScript and CSS, which allowed me to reuse existing know-how (and VisualStudio 2010), avoiding delving into the unfamiliar Android UI API. Initially, I was worried about the communication between the thin Android client and the web app. Fortunately, and I really love Google for implementing this feature, the Android WebView offers the \"addJavascriptInterface()\"-method, allowing me to create and specify an object that effectively bridges the web app's javascript and the Android app's Java code. This enabled me to make calls from the web app into the Android app, by creating javacript on the server side, which was then run inside the Android Webview, and finally handled by the Android app itself. While this can be used for web app to Android communication, I couldn't use this for push functionality, since the Android app would need to run in the background draining the battery. For true push based notifications, I used Google's Android Cloud 2 Device Messaging API (C2DM).<p>Integrating an .NET Ajax web application and an Android app with Google's C2DM wasn't trivial, and took a lot of experimentation, trial and error, and web searching. The first and easiest part was making the Android app register with google servers to receive noticiation messages. This required some special permissions in the AndroidManifest.xml file, -<p>&#60;permission android:name=\"no.skjervold.permission.C2D_MESSAGE\" android:protectionLevel=\"signature\" /&#62;\nuses-permission android:name=\"no.skjervold.permission.C2D_MESSAGE\" /&#62;<p>To register for notifications, the Android app then had to create an intent (com.google.android.c2dm.intent.REGISTER-intent), and a BroadcastReceiver had to be created to receive the registration ID. Upon receiving the registration ID, the Android app would now send it to my own web server (construcing a HttpGET), pairing it with a custom application ID, which I would then store in a database (DB4O).<p>The next step would be to make my web application Authenticate with Google's C2DM server. Google requires a two-step authentication process, where my web app makes a request, receives a special token, and then creates another request including this token. This can be a little tricky, and doing it from .NET probably made it a bit harder. The fact that Google requires SSL-connections resulted in issues connecting from .NET, which was finally solved with a hack requiring me to create my own System.Net.ICertificatePolicy, which basically overrides the CheckValidationResult()-method, always returning true. Once authenticated, my application would access my database, retrieve notification subcriptions and determine their C2DM registration IDs and the users' specified BTC index threshold values, and send notifications via Google's notification servers.<p>The result was an Anroid application downloadable from Android Market, allowing users to specify high and low BTC index values, and showing status bar notifications on Android devics only seconds after the index changes. No polling or background running required.<p>The application can be downloaded here for free: https://market.android.com/details?id=no.skjervold<p>The technology stack I chose seemed to work quite well, and the merger between a native Android app and a web application is surprisingly smooth. And this makes me wonder: Are application store specific technologies really the best way forward for mobile device applications? With the emergence of HTML5 and CSS3, wouldn't it be a lot cooler if I could create a web application that could run on both Android, IOS, WhinPhone and Blackberry systems? As of today, sure, one would only need to create a thin device client wrapper application to indeed run my app on all platforms, but with HTML5's support for local storage and stuff, this could probably be avoided all together. If device-specific API's was made accessible for the different platforms, web applicastions could access OS specific resources, such as status bar notifications. While HTML5 might not provide all the functionality needed to this, device OS providers could provide interfaces between OS resources and javascript, as Google has done with its Android WebView, effectively bridging web apps and device resources.<p>While I believe this approach would be great for both developers and consumers, less open device OS makers (I'm not going to name names here), probably don't want this to happen. I suspect that they want full control of their application stores and what's run on their platforms. Let's hope I'm wrong, and that the OS makers come to their senses in the future :)<p>Dr. Heisenberg", "date": "2011-06-09"}, {"title": "Ask HN: How did Snapchat gain initial traction?", "URL": "", "text": "How did an app like Snapchat gain initial traction?

It exists to help independent developers find great designers for short, one-off projects.

I was building a new iPad app, and started the project with just 2 devs and no designers. I thought I had a handle on cool, simple and elegant UI design, but had a nagging feeling that a real designer could help make major improvements in the app. Problem was, I didn't have the resources to hire a fulltime designer yet, didn't know anyone in my personal networks who had experience with the niche, and I couldn't trust the people I was finding on Craigslist and LinkedIn.<p>So I decided to launch a site that would help developers like me find the right designer efficiently, and thus answer the question: \"How's my UX?\". It has similarities to sites like eLance and 99Designs where designers \"bid\" on projects submitted by developers. Developers get to pick the designer based on reviews for past work, as well as demonstrable knowledge. A couple ways I plan to differentiate from those sites is a narrower focus on mobile UX, as well as fixed prices for each project. I have some other ideas that will be hugely beneficial for designers, but I don't want to discuss them publicly yet.<p>Any thoughts on this? I'd love to hear your opinion on whether there's a practical use for this, or is the premise fundamentally flawed somewhere?

I dislike having to add keywords for my website, add data for my competitors, etc. This generally happens because these SEO apps are generic.<p>How to solve this: Since this app focuses on a specific niche, it will already be setup with all the potential keywords for the niche (and will continously add new ones). All the data that the customers (people performing seo for hosting companies) want would already be in the system. A customer would only sign up with his domain(s) and the app would show him his serp rankings, onpage and offpage details about the SEO for his web pages and his competitors.<p>The reason I chose the 'hosting' industry is because its one of the industries with the costliest adwords cpc - which means that a small change in ranking could be potentially very large savings for the companies.

Currently we're on JIRA which is great for tracking at the task and issue level, but we feel that it doesn't have great support for managing documentation and application requirements.<p>Our vision for a PM tool is based around writing requirements and documentation first, then generating tasks based on creation of or editing those requirements. A requirements list might look like:<p><pre><code>    Business\n    |-Orders allowed only from 8AM-5PM\n    |-Order minimum is $5\n    |-...\n    UI\n    |-All tables have an 'Export' button\n    Etc\n</code></pre>\nEach requirement is a first-class item that can be modified, can have comments attached, etc. When changing a requirement, you can generate a task that is inserted into a backlog or sprint for a developer to work on. The requirements document would be version controlled along with the tasks that are generated for each requirement or change, so you can view requirements of a previous release. You would also be able to diff the requirements between versions to see changes between each and the tasks completed for those changes. Bugs could be filed against a requirement that is not working as intended.<p>The benefit we see is that your documentation is directly tied to your project management. Before a work task is generated, a requirement must be written in the documentation so it forces the documentation to be written (which is usually so rarely/poorly done). A lot of PM tools can integrate with Wikis, but it always feels like an after-thought and the wiki inevitably rots in many projects as effort isn't put forth to maintain it.<p>So, do any tools exist that do what we're searching for? We're not opposed to writing one ourselves, but obviously we'd like to save time and money by adopting an existing tool. Would anyone else be interested in using a tool like this?

Now what?", "URL": "", "text": "Hi HN, this is a long one - grab your popcorn.<p>[Removed some background info due to length, but the gist was that I\u2019ve had the entrepreneurial bug for as long as I can remember]<p>I just graduated from the General Engineering program [1] at the University of Illinois in December, and I can tell you that my time spent at UIUC was absolutely horrible.  Year after year, I was told things would get better- \u201cThese are just weed out classes, don\u2019t worry.  Things get better after this.\u201d  Year after year, things stayed the same.  In four years, I never felt inspired or motivated.  I tried switching majors, but was strongly advised against it due to a weak job market in the target field (industrial design).  I couldn\u2019t drop out or start over, because upwards of $100,000 was on the table for my education. I was surrounded my classmates who didn\u2019t give a shit about engineering or learning \u2013 their priority was making it through the week so they could get trashed on the weekends.  For a guy who doesn\u2019t drink, it\u2019s difficult to socialize with these kinds of people.  I laid low and pushed forward.  I studied for exams and did homework, but I never felt like I was an engineer.  I always felt like I was just doing busy work and that none of it really mattered. I never felt like I was learning.  Perhaps it was just my program, but you can imagine my distaste for engineering that was built up over the 4 year period.  It was the worst 4 years of my life.<p>Now that I\u2019ve graduated, apparently I am supposed to be looking for an engineering job.  But I\u2019m not, for two reasons.  The first is that I feel as though I am severely underqualified.  My final GPA is somewhat low (2.9) as the result of taking almost no GPA-boosting gen ed courses, and I have never participated in an engineering internship.  Instead, I spent time helping entrepreneurial family members build their businesses and worked on building businesses of my own.  Ultimately, most of my personal business endeavors failed, but the experience gained was invaluable.  The second reason is that I have a strong distaste for engineering, and could not picture myself being an engineer or working in an engineering-related field.<p>It\u2019s not all bad, though.  About 6 weeks before graduating (Dec \u201910), I had the urge to learn Ruby on Rails.  I have always been computer literate and tech savvy (html + css), but computer science seemed like an elusive, mystical thing.  Programming?  That\u2019s only for really, really smart kids, right?  Wrong.  Turns out it\u2019s actually pretty easy.  I started reading a few tutorials in late October and things finally clicked in January.  Since then, I\u2019ve been programming constantly.  I code for 10-16 hours a day until I get burnt out and fall asleep, then I wake up and do it again.  I love every minute of it.  My desires go beyond being a code monkey for the rest of my life, but for the time being, it\u2019s wonderful.  I love the startup scene and I could see myself doing this for the next few years.<p>Since January, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve made:<p>www.letspocket.com \u2013 note-taking tool (my first app)<p>www.madebyloren.com \u2013 blog engine written from scratch, with admin and comment system<p>www.peak4x4.com \u2013 full-featured offroad enthusiast network, with tagging, notifications, etc<p>www.boxify.me \u2013 file-sharing tool for groups (quick one-day app while AWS was down)<p>www.snowday2011.com \u2013 one-off t-shirt website aka \u201c4-hour profitable startup\u201d<p>In addition to the personal projects, I also built an inventory/tracking system for a biomedical waste processing facility, but the project is currently on hold due to founder issues.<p>I am thrilled with how far I\u2019ve come over the past few months.  I have I have tons and tons of ideas and I want to bring every one of them to life.  I never thought hat I could build things like these, and here I am busting them out one after another.  I\u2019ve been so focused on learning and building since January that I\u2019ve almost completely neglected monetizing.  Funds are running so low that I probably won\u2019t even be able to make next month\u2019s rent.  I would love to keep building apps, but it doesn\u2019t seem feasible unless something changes (aka get a job or learn to monetize).  So now I\u2019m getting desperate.<p>Here\u2019s my big dilemma: I am supposed to be seeking a job related to my area of study, but I want absolutely nothing to do with that field.  I\u2019ve fallen in love with programming, but I don\u2019t feel as though I\u2019m qualified enough for paid work.  I have a wide variety of skills (design, UI, html + css + javascript, Ruby on Rails coding), but I\u2019m not <i>excellent</i> at any of them.  I am also somewhat unconventional, as I have yet to learn to write good tests or follow TDD, for example.<p>I am not opposed to working for a startup, but who wants to hire the self-taught guy with 6 months programming experience when they can hire the guy with years of experience and a comp sci degree to prove it?\nI would enjoy freelance work (programming or design) but there are better programmers and better designers out there. I would also be competing for work with international freelancers who charge next to nothing on sites like freelancer.com.<p>So what do I do?  Do I apply for the engineering job I have a slight chance at getting hired for, but will probably hate?  Do I apply for programming positions that I am underqualified for?  Do I attempt to compete for freelance jobs? I feel like I\u2019m stuck.<p>I\u2019m pouring my deepest thoughts out to perfect strangers.  I would sincerely appreciate any advice and input you can offer.

I&#x27;d like to start by saying that The Wave is the FIRST COMPLETELY FREE NETWORK MARKETING COMPANY with NO CATCHES.<p>I. What is The Wave?<p>I have been a network marketer for about three years now, and one thing that really bothers me whenever I introduce someone in to the realm of truly great possibilities is that they are skeptical, having to put their own money in to the system. It works, I&#x27;ve great had success in it, but some people are just not motivated enough.<p>I developed The Wave to do one thing -- make a fair system where people can make money PURELY BASED OFF OF THEIR DRIVE AND EFFORT. I feel like the real problem in the world right now is that people are stuck thinking that they HAVE to get a college degree, they HAVE to have these certifications to make money.<p>The Wave is a network that is all ad-based, but NOT the spammy ads that you see all over websites. Every user activates ONE TIME a day, and then will make money when his&#x2F;her organization does the same for the day. The result? Building residual income.<p>II. How do I sign up?<p>You can sign up at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getsplashing.com, (front page is being modified so please ignore any odd design flaws you see). If you are using an invite code when registering, feel free to enter it. If you don&#x27;t, it will start your own team. There is really no difference between the two, besides helping someone else out.<p>III. How do I work this thing!?<p>When you log in, you will see your account page. This shows your left and right side activations, how much money you have made for the day, if you are currently active, your referral code, your money for the week, and the most recent person that you have referred.<p>If you click the activate tab, you will be redirected to our activation page. Simply click the button, watch the video until it&#x27;s gray, and you&#x27;re donezo! You&#x27;ll be activated until the counter below runs to 0, and then you will need to reactivate to be credited for any other activations below you.<p>If you go to the settings page, you will see where you can change your e-mail, set new signups through your referral code to the left or right, and new features will be added soon.<p>IV. Cool, so how do I make money?<p>Making money is VERY simple. When someone signs up through your referral code, they essentially start their own network. Their referrals will thus start their own network, so on and so forth. Think of it as a bunch of branches on a tree. The great thing about The Wave is that you make money off of EVERYONE&#x27;S branch that is underneath you, EVERY time they activate.<p>Thing is, if you aren&#x27;t activated when someone else below you does, you won&#x27;t get credit for their activation on whichever side underneath you they are. In other words, stay active! It literally takes a minute a day.<p>V. Sweet, and how do I get paid?<p>The way our payouts work are simple. You make $0.01 every time someone on each side activates. Basically, you are building an income from nothing to something off of building your network. You might be thinking, &quot;Only $0.01? That&#x27;s pretty low.&quot; We are in betaright now, and the company is completely free. We are working on increasing it, but the point is you are BUILDING here.<p>As for getting paid out, we are finishing the billing panel now. You will be able to get paid through Paypal or Skrill. You need a minimum balance of $10.00, and you can request a payment at any time. It will take us a maximum of one week to deliver it to you. *Your paypal &#x2F; skrill must be verified.<p>VI. CAN I BOT IT?!?!1&#x2F;1&#x2F;!?<p>No. We can tell, we will ban, we will not be nice. We have to keep our sponsors happy, and we can&#x27;t do that if you are using botnets, proxies, VPNs, etc. Therefore, do not bot or exploit in any way shape or form. We reward our users if they bring threatening exploits to our attention that we didn&#x27;t know about previously.<p>VII. Is there a limit?<p>Nope. No limit!<p>Sign up here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getsplashing.com\nLike the facebook page here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;The-Wave&#x2F;586915218036504<p>P.S.

So let's start.<p>The project name is Dressable or http://en.dressable.me/. The main idea is to simplify shopping process and try to solve some problems, that appear when \nyou are at a shop and would like to buy something. Two main causes are: you see something and you are sure, that you want to buy exactly this product,\nand exactly today. Meanwhile, it's very rare situation when people are so sure about something. Usually, they are looking for some ideas how to make a choice.\nTo solve this problem you can do shopping with your close friend, or with a boyfriend/girlfriend, or try to ask people in shop, or try to bring some fashion expert with you, even ask your parent for some certain age time frames. Some people can try to send MMS, or to call to someone and try to describe, what they are interested to buy.<p>So the main idea, from a customer's point of view, is to provide fast and reliable connections with people who influence you on fashion field. From technology point, it will be a client application, where you will be able to take a picture and discuss with people who influence you, in real-time. And solid back-end part with lots of data mining and information retrieval.<p>If you are interested, I can describe additional points of making money and some implementation points, or my background and experience in related fields\nand other questions, that you will ask.<p>I got good feedback from consumers, who is interested in our project and people with solid entrepreneurial background.

We make use of CDI throughout our application, but without any other formal application frameworks.  You won\u2019t find any Spring in our site <i>anywhere</i>.  A few years ago, Spring provided some real tangible benefits.  With JavaEE\u2019s recent changes and addition of CDI, there\u2019s really no need to add so many dependencies into your application.  Our Presentation&#x2F;UI layer makes use of JSF 2.2, with some additional JavaScript mixed in here and there.  Many people criticize the use of JSF, but we\u2019ve found it to fit our needs rather well - once you know what you\u2019re doing, that is.  There are definitely some headaches getting started.<p>Our Service Layer makes use of both EJBs and POJOs.  With recent changes to the JavaEE spec, there\u2019s really little difference these days.  EJBs have become much thinner in terms of memory usage and overhead.  Most of our EJBs are Stateless, as we have little need for long-running states.  We do make use of a few Message-Driven Beans (MDBs) that are used for asynchronous and event-based processing of data.  E-mail notifications, for example, are pushed out using MDBs.<p>Our Persistence Layer is Hibernate&#x2F;JPA.  While ORMs are often discouraged and avoided, they are really no better or worse than any other technology.  If you\u2019re not familiar with SQL, don\u2019t view ORMs as a way around this limitation.  We make use of triggers, stored procedures (functions), SQL views, and native SQL queries throughout our application.  There are times when pure JPA just doesn\u2019t get the job done for you.  One great CDI library we leverage in our Persistence Layer is [Apache Deltaspike](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;deltaspike.apache.org).  One of our favorite components is the Data Repository module.

We\u2019ve worked our asses off, we got one funding offer as well, but that was too low to do anything, we are based out of India.

A couple is usually diagnosed as infertile after one year of frequent, unprotected, sexual intercourse.<p>When you decide to seek treatment to improve fertility or to overcome infertility, making sure that you choose a good fertility clinic is very important. One of the most common procedures performed at these clinics is in vitro fertilization, also called IVF for short.<p>This is a procedure that combines sperm and eggs in a dish in a laboratory to form embryos. A select number of the embryos are then transferred to the uterus where they may implant and develop into a fetus. If successful, the woman will become pregnant and will go through her pregnancy just as any other woman who conceived naturally.<p>Today IVF or invitro fertilization is slowly emerging as one of the preferred answers to issues like infertility and cases of miscarriage and failure in conceiving. IVF clinics are mushrooming in most cities of the world claiming to provide top class treatment and sure shot result. However, it is absolutely imperative to understand the various features that are integral to good IVF clinics.<p>Choosing a fertility clinic is an important decision, and there are many factors that come into play. After researching fertility clinics\u2019 success rates and treatment offerings, you may want to supplement your knowledge by asking the fertility clinic some questions.<p>IVF clinics must have the following facilities.The clinic should also be able to contact special labs which have testing capabilities of such immunological obstruction. The clinic should enjoy the services of an Embryologist who should at least have a doctorate in chemical, biological or physical science. The person should have earlier performed at least 100 IVF procedures in a year. At least one person in the department must have expertise in fields like andrology, pre-implantation, pre and post fertilization and embryology.<p>So, IVF clinics must be the ones, which, not only assures you of efficiency but it does gets shown in the action as well.\nMost common facilities offered by IVF clinics worldwide include:<p>ART\nIVF\nIUI\nICSI\nSperm retrieval\nLaser assisted hatching\nSperm bank\nFreezing of embryo/oocyte/sperm\nDonation of sperm/egg/embryo\nSurrogacy and surrogates<p>Other services of IVF clinics include psychological counseling and also a rigorous process of screening when donors are involved.<p>Other factors that determine the choice a particular IVF clinic include factors like distance from home, the cost, the kind of counseling that is offered, the recommendations made by a certified doctor, the presence of a patient support group, the areas of specialization of the clinic, the rate of success achieved by the clinic, the kind of advertising that the clinic indulges in and reports and reviews by earlier patients or of friends and relatives who might know of the clinic.<p>Usually, doctors and specialists related to in vitro fertilization, IUI, or ICSI plan out the treatment in accordance with the medical reports of the tests conducted of an individual. Every individual has different sets of situation and disorders so is the treatment devised for them.<p>Keep in mind that clinic which has higher IVF cost is the only one catering quality treatment; instead clinic which is well organized and has expert doctors and medical facilities is the better one.<p>The key to ensuring that the IVF treatment process is relatively hassle-free is to choose the right clinic, one that lays down protocols and guidelines, advises Dr.Gautam Allahbadia,Is IVf ,surrogacy specialist and the Director of Rotunda -The Center for Human Reproduction, the world-renowned infertility clinic at Mumbai, India.<p>Parenthood is a life changing and eternally rewarding experience and Many have chosen IVF as a successful way to bring a child into their lives.<p>We will be happy to provide a second opinion on your conceiving a fertility problem.

Unhealthy eating patterns, stress,obesity,being overweight or underweight may also prove to be the risk factors.<p>Some of the factors that play an important role in male infertility are:<p>Sperm motility: Sperm motility is the ability of sperms to move towards the egg which results in its fertilization.Sperm which do not properly swim will not reach the egg in order to fertilize it.<p>Sperm count: Sperm count is the quantity of sperms or cells,the more the sperms more are the chances of normal pregnancy.A healthy sperm count should total about 20 million sperm per milliliter and the normal semen volume per ejaculation is 2 ml. Azoospermia is a condition in which there is complete absence of sperm.It can also be congenital.Correctible causes must be found and treated.Even then if there are no sperm in the ejaculate, sperm can often be harvested and used to achieve fertilization.<p>Sperm morphology:Sperm morphology refers to the size and shape (form) of an individual sperm which is evaluated during semen analysis.According to WHO manual of 1989, morphology is considered normal if it is around 30% or more.<p>Deficiency of any of these factors can result in the male infertility.<p>Evaluation of Male Infertility.<p>Fertility in men requires normal functioning of the hypothalamus,pituitary gland,and testes.Therefore,a variety of different conditions can lead to infertility.The evaluation of male infertility begins with a visit to a urologist.The urologist will begin with a basic interview and exam including<p><pre><code>  *  A full medical and reproductive history, along with any surgeries you've had and medications you're taking.\n  *  Lifestyle questions,including exercise,smoking,and drug use.\n  *  Physical exam.\n  *  Frank discussion about your sexual life, including any problems with sex or previous sexually transmitted diseases.\n</code></pre>\nIn any evaluation for male infertility,the man will need to provide a sample of semen for analysis.The doctor will want the man to give the sample there,or at least someplace nearby,since it's important that the analysis take place quickly.<p>How is male infertility treated?<p>The treatment for male infertility depends on the specific problem.In some severe cases,no treatment is available.However,many times there are a mix of medications, surgical approaches and assisted reproductive techniques (ART) available to overcome many of the underlying fertility problems.The options are:<p>Surgery: Minor outpatient surgery called varicocelectomy is frequently used to repair dilated scrotal veins (varicoceles). Studies have shown that repairing these dilated veins results in improved sperm movement,concentration and structure.In some cases, obstruction causing infertility can also be surgically corrected.In the case of a previous vasectomy,surgery using an operating microscope has been found to be very successful in reversing the obstruction.<p>Medication: Drugs are key in correcting retrograde ejaculation and immunologic infertility.In addition,pituitary hormone deficiency may be corrected with drugs such as clomiphene or gonadotropin.<p>If these techniques fail,fertility specialists uses high-tech assisted reproductive techniques that promote conception without intercourse.Depending on the problem physician may suggest<p>Intrauterine insemination (IUI): By placing sperm directly into the uterus via a catheter,IUI bypasses cervical mucus that may be hostile to the sperm and puts them close to the fallopian tubes where fertilization occurs.IUI is often successful in overcoming sperm count and movement problems, retrograde ejaculation,immunologic infertility and other causes of infertility.<p>In vitro fertilization (IVF): Refers to fertilization taking place outside the body in a laboratory Petri dish.There,the egg of a female partner or donor is joined with sperm. While IVF is employed mostly for women with obstructed fallopian tubes,it is occasionally used for men with oligospermia.<p>Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI): A variation of in vitro fertilization,this procedure has revolutionized treatment of severe male infertility, permitting couples previously thought infertile to conceive.It involves injecting a single sperm directly into the egg with a microscopic needle and then, once it is fertilized, transferring it to the female partner's uterus.Your doctor is likely to use ICSI if you have very poor semen quality or lack of sperm in the semen caused by an obstruction or testicular failure.In some cases,sperm may be surgically extracted from the testicles or epididymis for this procedure.<p>Modern scientific technologies like ART, ICSI,and IUI have made the treatment of male infertility easy.However,this treatment can be very expensive and can burn a hole in your pocket.Today inexpensive methods are also available without any compromise on the treatment and methodology.Awareness of the magnitude and importance of the male factor in infertility is relatively recent.Tremendous advances have been made in andrological research over the past few years.If not today,one can envisage in the conceivable future,a situation where all males (and females) with infertility can be completely cured.<p>Always remember that infertility can be cured like any other disease and it does not mean that your masculinity is at stake.By being fit you can fight infertility.So it's crucial that men get tested for fertility as well as women.Yes,it can be embarrassing,but discovering male fertility problems early can mean earlier treatment and a successful pregnancy.Male infertility testing can also spare women unnecessary discomfort and expense.<p>You can Starting treating Male infertility today by contacting Rotunda Clinic:<p>All Appointments are scheduled according to your convenience at Rotunda Fertility clinic,Embryo Adoption Clinics.\nYou can contact for further assistance at http://surrogacymumbai.com or http://wewantababy.com or http://www.iwannagetpregnant.com or http://ivftreatmentindia.wordpress.com or email at surrogacymumbai.india@gmail.com or simply a phone call at +91 22 2655 2000 or +91 22 26405000.", "date": "2012-04-26"}, {"title": "5 Tips start new Fertility clinic", "URL": "", "text": "IVF Lab forms an integral part of the fertility clinic. IVF Lab provides a wide variety of services to the fertility clinic and its patients. In today\u2019s time fertility clinic without an ivf lab is unimaginable. Since the birth of the first in vitro fertilization (IVF) or \u2018test tube\u2019 baby in 1978, the field of IVF has been transformed with several technological discoveries and has made the dreams of many infertile couples come true of conceiving their own baby.<p>The embryology laboratory, where embryos are produced, grown and nourished during an IVF cycle, is one of the key components of a fertility center. While patients don\u2019t necessarily know what happens behind the scenes during an IVF cycle or how their embryos are produced, having a state-of-the-art embryology laboratory is what separates an average from an excellent fertility center.<p>The embryology laboratory, is a place where embryos are produced, grown and nourished during an IVF cycle and is one of the key components of a fertility center. While patients don\u2019t necessarily know what happens behind the scenes during an IVF cycle or how their embryos are produced, having a state-of-the-art embryology laboratory is what separates an average ivf center from an excellent ivf fertility center. In vitro fertilisation treatment takes place in a container in a laboratory. In short the IVF laboratory is the place where the eggs, sperm and embryos are handled and IVF is performed. It is an extremely important part of the IVF process.<p>The question arises is why is an IVF Laboratory needed or it is important for any fertility center?<p>1]\nState of the ART IVF Laboratory\nThe IVF laboratory contains the newest and most advanced equipment for the production of healthy embryos. Incubators are capable of producing a reduced oxygen environment for culturing embryos to the blastocyst stage. Additional laboratory techniques may be performed including extended culturing to the blastocyst stage, Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection - ICSI, assisted hatching, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), and embryo cryopreservation.<p>2]\nCustomised Video Processing\nAll modern equipments comes with all provision of image processing which is very well utilized by Combination of hardware camera selection and software selection. Multiple Camera inputs can be synthesised in one system to have better recording and processing.<p>3]\nAir Quality evaluation and improvement\nThe environment where the embryos grow is of paramount importance. It has been shown that the air of the laboratory itself can alter the quality of the embryos produced. Embryos are sensitive to microbes, particles and volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the air. IVF Lab is equipped with most advanced HVAC (heating ventilation and air conditioning) systems to overcome this problem. This system can supply constant temperature and controlled humidity despite climate and seasonal variation to provide a stable environment in order to achieve the maximum performance of all the delicate laboratory equipment. IVF Lab evaluates Air quality on existing Lab and recommend appropriate steps to improve the same. It varies from HVAC inspection to microbial air sampling.<p>4]\nClean Room Laboratory Isolation\nThe laboratory is also isolated from the outside environment by having tightly sealed walls, ceilings, light fixtures utility connections and airtight doors making it \u2018impermeable\u2019 to contaminant agents, microbes and airborne toxins from leaking in. The embryology laboratory is held pressurized above the adjacent procedure rooms so that air moves from the embryology lab to the procedure room and out. This would prevent any contaminant or toxin in the air from coming into the lab through the doors. Laboratories that are poorly designed can lead to decreased pregnancy rates due to embryo toxic materials in the air. Failure to isolate the sensitive and delicate embryo from these materials can lead to increase stress on the developing embryo resulting in decreased pregnancy rates.<p>5]\nEmbryology Services\nIVF Lab provides assistance in providing complete embryology services from Ovum Pick-up to embryo transfer. Qualified and experienced team of clinicians and embryologists carry out these services.<p>Hence it is advisable for fertility clinic to have their own IVF lab or embryology laboratory. The fertility clinic should design the embryology laboratory with one aim of helping their patients to provide the best services and to take home their baby.  Setting up of new laboratory requires contacting designers, architects, sellers, resellers, vendors, suppliers, agents, distributors to initiate slow, long and laborious process of discussing dates and negotiating rates.

Laboratory centrifuges work by the sedimentation principle, where the centripetal acceleration is used to separate substances of greater and lesser density.<p>Spermfuge is an improvised centrifuge, dedicated totally for elevating the total motile sperm recovery from the parent semen sample, by controlling/maintaining the main parameter of \"Temperature\" thus aimed at Enhancing the ART results.The goal of all sperm preparation techniques is to improve sperm quality in ART. The ejaculated spermatozoa have to be separated quickly and efficiently from the seminal plasma so that they can be functional. The two routinely used preparation techniques are swim-up and discontinuous density gradient techniques. Since men with abnormal semen parameters do not yield adequate motile sperm, it needs to be processed prior to its use in ART. The instrument has been designed to regulate and subsequently maintain the \"Critical\" inner chamber temperature before, after and during centrifugation. Maintenance of this critical temperature throughout the entire sperm processing procedure helps the sperm maintain their peak motility and enhanced linearity. The two of the most vital parameters which act as a yard stick to gauge the effectiveness of an ideal sperm wash. The existing dependency on RPM will be eliminated by on screen g-force selection.<p>The main objective of the spermfuge is to evaluate the effect of temperature on the sperm motion characteristics and subsequent outcome of sperm preparation.<p>Use of temperature regulated centrifuge (Spermfuge) improves sperm quality.Thus spermfuge acts as the two of the most vital parameters which act as a yard stick to gauge the effectiveness of an ideal sperm wash in all Ivf IUI ART ICSI labs and clinics. Sperm retrieval techniques form an integral part of the assisted reproductive programme. The success of sperm separation is measured by the number of motile sperm retrieved from a given semen sample. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of temperature during sperm preparation events on the number and percentage motile sperm retrieved following a double wash swim-up procedure.<p>The design of the spermfuge has been framed after taking consideration detailed cellular physiological demands, locomotion kinetics and pooling together ideal suggestions, opinions, ideas and propositions of numerous Andrologists and Embryologists and other professionals in the field of Human Reproduction. The Spermfuge with its Temperature controlled chamber (room temperature to 42\u00b0C), programmable microprocessor based controls, multiple tube selection, accurate g-force selection, independent centrifugation and/or heating selection and other added advantages make it an ideal state of the art instrument for use in an ART laboratory.<p>The heating range of Spermfuge's chamber is from 2\u00b0C above ambient to 42\u00b0C.Unless and untill the set temperature is attained the intelligent control system does not allow the centrifugation to commence. However the ART Laboratory have the option to commence the centrifugation without chamber heating and to commence the chamber heating without centrifugation.<p>Various clinics, laboratories and regulatory bodies have their own different set of protocols to be followed. The Spermfuge facilitates user selectable 9 programs for different applications. The user can select RCF, RPM, Tube Size, Temperature, Time for each program by a digital encoder as per the requirement of there clinic. Thus spermfuge has the capacity of multiple programs.<p>An adjustable brake is provided to prevent the rotor from stopping too quickly at the end of run which might cause disturb to the firmly formed pellet. One can select 3 mode in acceleration and braking, slow medium and to fast can be given on screen.<p>The exact indication of G - Force helps the ideal sperm pellet formation by subjecting the sperm to an exact and precise amount of G - Force unlike other Centrifuges where G - Force is subject to RPM and the tube size. Now a days centrifugation speeds are never reported in RPM as those numbers are not useful for any one wanting to reproduce the method. (Being dependent Rotor radius.)<p>Spermfuge has a swing out rotor head to accommodate 8 tubes maximum of 15 ml. The Sperm Fuge can accommodate 6ml Tubes (Falcon 2003), 14 ml Tubes (Falcon 2001) and 15 ml Tubes (Falcon 2095). The tube selection can be done on screen with the help of the encoder, which ensures an exact G - Force selection.<p>The Vision port in the lead at the center helps to confirm rotational speed with a stroboscopic device. The safety interlock in the lead prevents accidental opening once the Rotor is operational. The maximum RCF is 800g which prevents accidental damage to the sperm.<p>State of the art micro-controller with optomagnetic encoder provides intelligent control system. Digital programming via microprocessor control for various parameters including temperature, RCF and time. The parameters are displayed on four line LCD display.<p>The Spermfuge is virtually maintenance free since it utilizes brushless drive motor. The motor is extremely smooth even during running at the maximum speed. The motor is electrically controlled during the acceleration and breaking with smoothness.<p>Centrifuge temperature and incubation temperature significantly influenced the percentage retrieved motile sperm. The use of temperature-controlled sperm preparation might have clinical value for men with poor sperm motility values.<p>An efficient sperm preparation method is one that preserves sperm motility, viability and fertilization capacity during assisted reproduction procedures. Temperature regulated centrifugation (Spermfuge) improves sperm motility and longevity\nwhen compared to a non-temperature regulated centrifuge.<p>Shivani Scientific Industries is exporter, manufacture and supplier of ivf lab equipments like microinjection tools,ivf workstations,Spermfuge,ThermoPlate, Embryo Freezer,System for ART,Suction Pumps for oocyte aspiration,CO2 incubator,IVF warming block,IVF micromanipulator,IVF Microscope,IVF Micropipettes,Clean Air System, Spermfuge,Mobile Nest,Lab Guard,Warming Blocks,Turnkey Projects,Rapid Recovery System and lab designs to IVF clinics worldwide.

Gmail filters are amazing but I'm having a lot of trouble using Gmail on a daily basis I just don't know why. I think filters should be more easily reachable.

Since this is a Hacker Community I thought you all might be interested in some stats and info about the project:<p>---<p>I think MagicScroll's doing pretty well in terms of uptake but I don't have any kind of tracking implemented yet so I'm a bit blind.<p>I've got just over 6000 users from the Chrome Web Store.<p>https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ghgnmgfdoiplfmhgghbmlphanpfmjble<p>On my server logs I get between 700 and 900 hits to my cache manifest file every 24 hours with more over the weekend. As near as I can tell users turn a books page an average of just less than 400 times an hour.  (Each page turn involves a round trip to the server for syncing purposes). More than 95% of the hits are coming from Chrome so I think there's a lot of room to expand.<p>---<p>I didn't build MagicScroll as a commercial venture but based on its limited popularity I do think it has the potential to create revenue, and I now hope to build a business around it.  In the next month or so I plan to create a paid extension similar to Readability that will allow websites to be read using MagicScroll.  I also intend to build an API for booksellers to allow MagicScroll to be integrated into their stores.  If MagicScroll does gain a significant number of users I hope to integrate my own ebook store into it but I think that will be in a year or twos time at the earliest.<p>---<p>For those of you interested in the programming side.  It is built in GWT and runs on the Google App Engine.  I'm embarrassed to say that I don't have any real knowledge of javascript though I'm trying to rectify that.  There are about 30 lines of native javascript in the project most of which facilates communication between the frame that holds the book and the UI.<p>The entire project is heavily cached and apart from unzipping the ePUB and some security logic everything happens clientside.  There are obviously a lot of advantages to this and it was quite easy to do because I was working in GWT.  In fact I found that the same logic on the client often runs significantly faster than it does on the App Engine server.<p>To do page rendering I'm using a very simple binary search.  I draw a page with a certain number of characters and if it overflows I draw it half the size and then half between that and so on.  It's quick but I have no idea how Google has managed to get their pages in Google Books to render so fast, or to change the font size without redrawing.<p>One thing I've perhaps overrelyed on is AsyncCallbacks here's part of the code that draws the book:<p><pre><code>        LoadDialog.get().show(\"Loading Book.

SimpleCallback is just like AsyncCallback but without the onFailure method.  If an exception occurs the program halts instead of recovering.<p>I made it so that whenever an uncaught exception occurs I get emailed about it.  This has massively increased my stress levels but I think its contributed to the stability of the code so I'll probably do the same in the future.  I now get less than 20 errors a day.

I'm a long-time HN contributor, but I can't use my real profile right now as I was hired through it.<p>Basically, I started a job as a software engineer as a very early stage employee with a startup in the Denver area in August. It was two guys, one of whom was handling the business side of things (and bankrolling it), and the other who was the CTO. I was highly impressed by the business guy, and while the CTO didn't have the same \"wow\" factor, he didn't say anything obviously stupid in the interview process and I saw no reason we wouldn't be able to work together.<p>At first, things were going pretty well. They were extremely flexible regarding things like sick days and working from home, and even said that they were both family men and understood that things happen and that there's no reason a software engineer can't work from home in that event. The pay was good for a startup, there were decent benefits, and I had a decent amount of flexibility with how I did my job.<p>Now, though, it's like night and day. Today, we were told that there is no such thing as sick time, effective immediately. If you're sick and didn't get advance approval, it's a vacation day. Their vacation policy went from \"we can be flexible - let us know when you need time off and we'll work it out\" to \"you have two weeks a year and no more.\"  I've gone from being a full-stack developer who prefers working on the server side to being told that I'm supposed to be an on-call web developer in case the business folks decide we need website changes. The CTO's attitude towards myself and the other software guys has changed from \"I want smart people and want them do their thing\" to \"I want code monkeys who won't question my judgement.\" I could go on, but the point is that it feels like the company has a form of manic depression, and I don't have enough pull to fix the things that are broken.<p>Is there anyone out there looking for a software engineer?

We\u2019ve seen software to help us with mundane paperwork and calculation type tasks, but now technology is reaching an entirely new level. The ease with which we\u2019re able to control the physical world from something as common place as our smartphones is here!<p>Let\u2019s talk a little bit about the Arduino and its insane capacity to control our physical world from a mobile device.<p>There are already a couple good resources on setting up the iPhone to communicate with an Arduino. I recommend going through this tutorial first:<p>http://makeprojects.com/Project/Connect-an-iPhone-iPad-or-iPod-touch-to-Arduino-with-the-Redpark-Serial-Cable/1130/1<p>Currently, one of the simplest ways to make your iPhone control a motor, array of LED lights, or a household appliance is to use serial communication. Serial communication is a standard protocol that allows you to transmit bytes over a cable link. The Red Park cable allows you to convert an iPhone port to a traditional serial communication port that you can feed into the Arduino. This gives you the ability to communicate messages between your iPhone/iPad and a physical device connected to an Arduino.<p>When communicating via the serial communication port, one of the more complicated tasks is managing the messages that go between the iPhone device and the Arduino. There are a range of communication protocols that you can define using the byte length characters that can be sent over serial communication. We are going to go over two basic types of communication: state-based execution and a data load sequence.<p>1) state-based execution<p>A simple switch communication protocol is as easy as it sounds. Within your Arduino code, you will read in the serial data:<p>byte cmd;<p>cmd = Serial.read();<p>and then create a switch statement to execute different functions based on the \u201cread-in\u201d character (which indicates the desired state).<p><pre><code>      switch(cmd){\n\n        case \u2018p\u2019:\n\n          //play function\n\n          break;\n\n        case \u2018u\u2019:\n\n          //pause function\n\n          break;\n\n        case \u2018r\u2019:\n\n          //resume function\n\n          break;\n</code></pre>\n2) Load Sequence<p>A more complex implementation of Serial communication may require you to actually transmit useful data between the iPhone and the Arduino. In this case, you would need to define a protocol to communicate that information. We will again use an implementation of the flag-based execution, but will add a character \u2018l\u2019 to define a mode to load data.<p><pre><code>        case \u2018l\u2019:\n\n          //load function\n\n          break;\n</code></pre>\nNext we need to define the data package that we will be sending to the Arduino. An example would be to define the number of bytes for necessary metadata and then assume the remainder of the package is the described data. An example of metadata would be to have the first 4 bytes of each data package contain the size of the data package by taking the sum of the first 4 bytes. This allows you to correctly parse the data in the Arduino code.<p>We should then define the load function that will actually read in data from the iPhone. This function will need to read in a series of data pieces from the iPhone. The first piece would be the meta data so you could immediately set a mode for reading the meta data as follows (mode = 1):<p><pre><code>      if(mode ==-1){\n\n        if(index &#60; 4){\n\n          dataLength = dataLength+Serial.read();\n\n          index++;\n\n        }\n\n      }\n</code></pre>\nThis bit of code will read in the meta data while in \u201cmeta data\u201d mode and give you the total data package length.<p>With the data package length, you can then easily read in the remainder of the data using a similar mode for \u201cdata read\u201d (mode = 2):<p><pre><code>      if(mode ==\u20192\u2019){\n\n        if(index &#60; dataLength){\n\n          data[index] = Serial.read();\n\n        index++;\n\n        }\n</code></pre>\nNow that we\u2019ve taken care of the Arduino side, let\u2019s take a look at how the data is being sent from the iPhone. If you\u2019ve successfully completed the Redpark tutorial, you should be familiar with the RscMgr package. The iPhone code will simply take an array of data and send it using the RscMgr command for serial write. Here is an example of code you can put in your button-click function:<p><pre><code>         //define a temporary array\n\n         UInt8 temp[dataLength+1];\n\n    temp[0] = \u2018l\u2019;\n\n    for(int i=1; i&#60;dataLength;i++){\n\n        temp[i+1] = (UInt8)someDataElement; //for example a digit = 0\n\n    }\n\n\n          //send data over serial connection\n\n    for (int i = 0; i&#60;songLength; i++) {\n\n        txBuffer[i] = temp[i];\n\n        if (i%128 == 0) {\n\n            [rscMgr write:txBuffer Length:128];\n\n            NSLog(@\u201dwrote index:%i\u201d,i);\n\n        }\n\n        else if (songLength == i)\n\n            [rscMgr write:txBuffer Length:128];\n\n    }\n</code></pre>\nYou\u2019ll notice that the buffer size here is defined in lengths of 128 bytes. If your data package is more than 128 bytes, you will have to create an extra handler to combine the data after being sent over serial. This is due to limitations of the Arduino serial buffer size. Another important consideration is the memory limitations of your Arduino model. An Arduino Uno model only has 2 MB of memory available to read and store real-time data. Not ideal for a production package in many cases, but great for creating prototypes!<p>Here you have it, a data package communicated to the Arduino from the iPhone.

Low resolution copies (for sharing) will be stored on your CloudFront distribution.<p>--------<p>The details<p>The state of photo sharing is absolutely horrible. Most people upload photos to Facebook and I won't even go into the 1001 reasons why their photo service is abysmal. Some use Picassa or Flickr, while better than Facebook they still control the destiny of your photos. Flickr's got APIs - so that's a start but it's not trivial to get all your photos and their meta data (comments, tags, etc).<p>What I'm envisioning is a frontend for YOUR photo collection that resides in an Amazon S3 bucket you own.

Just a few thoughts I wanted to share and invite discussion from other HNers taking the classes.<p>Database Class, taught by Prof. Jennifer Widom: This class covers a lot of the Database background theory and practical that anyone working with knowledge/information storage systems <i>will</i> find useful. Quite frankly, being well versed with both SQL and NoSQL databases, my initial interest in this class was non-existent; I only signed up for it with the intention of later dropping out. Midway through, I think in terms of learning delivered, this class handily beats the other two. The way the class is being run leaves absolutely no cause for complaints.<p>1. The material has (obviously) been very painstakingly prepared by Prof. Widom. When teaching about XML databases, she spent the entire class time working in an actual text editor with XML file open, demonstrating the concepts. Similarly, for the SQL class, she spent the entire time in an actual SQL query GUI. This is VERY effective. Instead of just scribbling on a sheet of paper, this conveys a lot more information, in far less time. It is also a lot more rigorous - which is the next point. Lectures are broken into 10-30 minute \"topics\" following natural breaks in the material.<p>2. The entire material, including the exercises are VERY rigorously prepared. There are rare errors in speaking (and there can be no errors when demo-ing with real query engines, for example). When there <i>are</i> those rare errors, Prof. Widom has taken the time to review the recordings and added corrective annotations which do not detract. It is easy to underestimate the value of this point - in a live class one can always stop and question the prof about something that confuses you, but in a recording you can't. Rigour is essential to an effective video lecture.<p>3. The exercises have been developed with a lot of thought. They are moderately tough, rarely easy. Also, they come with actual query/db workbenches for you to try out your answers before submitting. This has enabled about as much learning as the lecture itself. If the questions were typical bookish variety or busywork, they would have not taught anything. The fact that trial and error is allowed also aids significantly in learning.<p>4. The professor also takes the time out to do fireside \"chats\" every week. This adds a rather nice touch of interactivity.<p>Pros: Good technical/platform, very well prepared material, perfect presentation, challenging exercises.\nCons: no feedback on quiz questions after due date. Considering how challenging some of them are, a review session going over the \"ideal\" solutions after the due date would be very helpful.<p>All in all, a VERY successful implementation. Kudos as well as thanks to Prof. Widom and team!<p><i>Machine Learning class</i>: Taught by Prof. Andrew Ng. Prof. Ng is famous for (amongst other things) his popular tutorials on various things in machine learning. He is clearly a good educator, and the course follows, technologically, the same structure as DB class. That said, the course seems to target a (very low) common denominator, and at least in my opinion wastes a lot of time in basics. An entire set of videos were spent teaching Octave. About halfway through only very basics of machine learning have been covered - even there, an inordinate amount of time is spent on terminology and very little on actually taking about real world applications and problems related to that (this was the promise when the course started). The review questions aid in review of the material present, but rarely challenges one to learn beyond what has been said in the lectures. The programming exercises are a very nice feature and the test-and-submission-rig that has been built are quite good. That said, once again, a typical programming exercise involves not more than 1-2 lines of code in each part with 5-8 parts to an exercise. This yet again, just seems like learning to code in Octave.<p>Overall, I'd say that its a very good introductory class, but spends too much time on very basic stuff. The technical infrastructure is good, content is well prepared but is just not challenging enough. It does not transfer enough knowledge per unit time consumed. If its content level were improved, it would be a great class.<p>Pros: Good tech, well prepared material.\nCons: low knowledge transfer rate, low level content.<p><i>Artificial Intelligence</i>: Taught by Profs. Thrum and Norvig. Both of them are giants in the field of AI, and Prof. Norvig literally wrote the Bible on it :-)<p>That said, the technical infrastructure around the class is detracting. Review question embedded inside the videos themselves, while cool in theory, are very distracting when actually trying to understand something. Also, breaking up lecture segments into 1-3 minutes chunks disrupts all focus. While the material is reasonably advanced (and thus makes for a terrific potential to learn things), there is a distinct lack of rigour in the way its presented. Having errors in algorithms scribbled on screen (while natural) is very disruptive when actually trying to understand. Around due dates, the website invariably dies, last time remaining unavailable for over a day.<p>Pros: good set of topics, good material\nCons: Bad technology/platform - very disruptive to actual learning. Lack of rigour and preparation in presentation.<p>These are ofcourse my personal views and I do not wish to detract from the humongous efforts on the part of all the faculty, the knowledgelabs team and all other people who have worked very hard to bring these classes to hundreds of thousands of people.<p>How do the other HNers feel about the classes you are taking?", "date": "2011-11-07"}, {"title": "Ask HN: Low-cost CRM solution for non-profits?", "URL": "", "text": "I&#x27;m looking to create a simple CRM solution for a non-profit that is tech-savvy, but doesn&#x27;t want to spend much on the infrastructure (especially not per-user recurring monthly costs, as volunteers should join without much effort or additional cost).<p>It needs to track mostly the communication: if a volunteer would like to care about a given client, they will be able to look through the recent activities, e-mails, phone call memos, and do what they want to do about it.<p>One way is to archive all incoming and outgoing mail, and index them in a database, unless the receiver opts out (due to the personal nature of the mail).

Refused all (except for one). I think for a living &#38; write books not interviews. This is what I have to say.)\nThe Japanese Nuclear Commission had the following goals set in 2003: \" The mean value of acute fatality risk by radiation exposure resultant from an accident of a nuclear installation to individuals of the public, who live in the vicinity of the site boundary of the nuclear installation, should not exceed the probability of about 1x10^6 per year (that is , at least 1 per million years)\".<p>That policy was designed only 8 years ago. Their one in a million-year accident occurred about 8 year later. We are clearly in the Fourth Quadrant there.<p>I spent the last two decades explaining (mostly to finance imbeciles, but also to anyone who would listen to me) why we should not talk about small probabilities in any domain. Science cannot deal with them. It is irresponsible to talk about small probabilities and make people rely on them, except for natural systems that have been standing for 3 billion years (not manmade ones for which the probabilities are derived theoretically, such as the nuclear field for which the effective track record is only 60 years).<p>1) Small probabilities tend to be incomputable; the smaller the probability, the less computable. (Forget the junk about \"Knightian\" uncertainty, all small probabilities are incomputable). (See TBS, 2nd Ed., or Douady and Taleb, Statistical undecidability, 2011.)<p>2) Model error causes the underestimation of small probabilities &#38; their contribution (on balance, because of convexity effects). Any model error, just as any undertainty about flying time causes the expected arrival to be delayed (you rarely land 4 hours early, more often 4 hours late on a transatlantic flight, so \"unforeseen\" disturbances tend to delay you). See my argument about second order effects with my paper. [INTUITION: uncertainty about the model used for calculation of random effects causes a second layer of randomness, causing small probabilities to rise on balance].<p>3) The problem is more acute in Extremistan, particularly the manmade part. The probabilities are undestimated but the consequences are much, much more underestimated.<p>4) As I wrote, because of globalization, the costs of natural catastrophes are increasing in a nonlinear way.<p>5) Casanova problem (survivorship bias in probability): If you compute the frequency of a rare event and your survival depends on such event not taking place (such as nuclear events), then you underestimated that probability. See the revised note 93 on \u03b1\u03b4\u03b7\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd.<p>6) Semi-technical Example: to illustrates the point (how models are Procrustean beds):\n[see http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/notebook.htm]<p>Take for example the binomial distribution with B[N, p] probability of success (avoidance of failure), with N=50. When p moves from 96% to 99% the probability quadruples. So small imprecision around the probability of success (error in its computation, uncertainty about how we computed the probability) leads to enormous ranges in the total result. This shows that there is no such thing as \"measurable risk\" in the tails, no matter what model we use.<p>---------<p>Nassim's full blog/notebook here:\nhttp://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/notebook.htm", "date": "2011-03-17"}, {"title": "Show HN: 7courses, the recipe manager.

This is objectively true (ahee!).<p>Callbacks make sense for UI widgets. In this case, the programmer is not the one generating the event, the user is.<p>But when the programmer is initiating some high-latency request with a completion event, why not just expose synchronous functionality and let it be composed and made asynchronous using blocks?<p>The control flow for chaining delegate callback based class functionality is so disgusting! Think about it. You send a message. Later, control flow continues at some point which, in the standard cocoa delegate pattern, i can only discern by looking at your documentation or headers. In addition, if there are multiple points where the initial message might have been sent, i may even have to DEMULTIPLEX using some state i have kept on the initial message send points to determine which is which. At this point, i might even send ANOTHER message with a callback, which i also have to track through documentation and track with my eyeballs through some crappy ad-hoc demultiplexing if statement because there is no general language facility for handling this problem. Also, you may or may not be able to determine the context of the send using just the method parameters. YUCK!<p>Finally, my question: Don't you agree? Why don't we prefer to expose synchronous functionality when possible and let the user compose it using blocks and either operation queues or grand-central dispatch?

I made it a point to be very descriptive with my wireframe notes as well as building the wireframe as close as I could to the real thing. Any programmer should have the ability to spend no more than 30 minutes on the functional wireframe and get the point of the entire platform and how it all ties in together. I designed the wireframe for both the web designer and programmer so it almost looks and functions as I would want it to once finished and thus far it has been on point. So based on how I've handled things on my end, how could I determine that a programmer is efficiently working and not wasting time?I've hired them through odesk so I do get to see screen shots. I am using a repository (github) so I do have access to fresh code every week. The language it's being built on is Python with jquery framework.

Here's the situation:\nA biz dev guy with pretty good experience and an excellent graphics/UI designer came to me with an idea to develop something.  I didn't love the idea but I liked the space and the team so we talked for a while about what we would actually build.  What we are building is significantly different from the idea they came to me with and they had no previous development, just a great flash demo.  They have spent some money on lawyer fees, branding, and a couple contractors but it probably only totals ~$10k and some of it is friends/family money as convertible debt.  I do significant work on the actual product strategy and UX, not just development, as well as a good bit of market research.  Basically anything that a founding member of a company would do just because he is passionate about the idea and wants the company to be super successful.  When I first joined, they wanted to consider me a product consultant and I was cool with that because I have never worked with them. Now we're about a month away from launching our first version of the app and I'm looking back on how significant and co-founder like things I have done.  I asked them to consider me a co-founder and they declined with this email:\n\"we agreed that we really want to stick to a literal definition of a co-founder, which we would define as being one of the people who conceived of the initial idea for the business, made the initial investments of time and money, and recruited the team to execute the idea.\" Of course there was a follow up conversation and more to come but that was the initial email I received.  On top of that they mentioned they didn't know me well enough but we have been working together for about 8 months.  While we don't know each other extremely well because we are all remote, they are taking a risk on me just like I am taking a risk on them by working for only equity, so that point seems invalid.<p>My question to YC is - Does it sound like I am a co-founder?  If so, how much should I care about getting this title?<p>In general titles don't matter too much to me but it really bothers me that it's such a big deal to them to give me this title when I feel I have clearly earned it.

If there are offerings tailored to CS grads they are mostly (imho) buzzword-laden (i.e. App, hype.js or enVogueAsAService) and mainly want front-end or GUI devs. This is probably due to my location (Germany) where the main industrial power is still concentrated in the automotive sector and the (pure) CS sector is virtually non-existent.

(Right, right\u2026 doesn't everyone?)<p>//About us:\nWe're two guys creating a rich internet application to streamline online collaboration. The need for this product is something we both recognized independently, while working in two completely dissimilar industries. We did our research, identified several shortcomings prevalent in existing products, and developed a unique application to address these issues. I come from a background in web development and graphic design, so I'm handling the UX/UI. My partner started and expanded multiple social initiatives as a teenager and currently works in finance; he's handling the business end.<p>We've made great progress, but we're clearly missing 1/3 of the team without our technical co-founder. We want to get this person on board immediately so they can help shape the product from the beginning. Equity will be split evenly between the 3 of us, assuming we all get along during a short trial period and decide to work together permanently.<p>//Our progress:\nWe've taken care of all the major up-front research; competitive analysis, market research, tentative financial projections, and so on. Thanks to my partner, we've already been speaking regularly with several potential investors, including one who is the Managing General Partner of a $150+ million early stage venture capital firm.<p>On the technical front, we've done a fair amount of research on different RIA frameworks/toolkits. We're not sold on any particular one, but would instead like our technical co-founder to take the lead and make the final decision. So this person will have direct influence on the product right out of the gate.<p>//We have:\n1) A comprehensive business plan. It's been strengthened with feedback from several entrepreneur friends. A couple of investors are looking it over now.\n2) Detailed mockups. We've shown them to several groups of people and iterated based on feedback.\n3) Detailed notes on app functionality/flow. We're also working on a more formal functional spec doc, but want our tech co-founder to help with that.<p>//What our tech co-founder should have:\n1) Genuine interest in online collaboration\n2) Ambition; the desire to work on an original idea that isn't just a copycat product with a minor twist \n3) Adaptability and an open mind\n4) The ability to articulate technical concepts and lead/instruct others\n5) Desire to actively contribute to a project, not just write code<p>If this piques your interest, we'd love to chat. We're based in NYC, so we can do coffee if you're in the area, or Skype/phone if you're not. We're open to having someone work remotely, but we're more than happy to assist in relocation to NYC if that interests you.<p>//Tl;dr:\nWe're two guys who work really well together and bring complimentary skills to the table. We have a unique product idea, connections to investors, and we're looking for a talented tech co-founder eager to work on an innovative product.<p>Please feel free to express interest here or send an email to hi@kalude.com. \nIf you email, we would appreciate the inclusion of links to previous work (or your GitHub account, or something\u2026) so we have a frame of reference when getting back to you. We have no idea what kind of response to expect from this, if any, but we'll do our best to get back to everyone.<p>//A little more about us:\nI'm a project manager at a digital marketing agency. It's a very small group, so I've had plenty of experience getting my hands dirty in various areas. I've tinkered with open source content management systems, done a little bit of database work, created countless wireframes and workflow mockups, and so on. Additionally, I've been developing websites since age 12, so I have about 15 years of front end coding experience. I possess enough technical knowledge to hold my own in a conversation about technical minutiae, so if we need to have real a discussion about latency issues due to scaling, I won't just stare and ask if we should 'get more bandwidths'. My responsibilities include:\n1) The UX and UI (in our product, these are atypically major components)\n2) Project management\n3) Marketing\n4) Front-end coding (when I can be of use)<p>My partner is handling the business side. He has a history of starting and expanding global social initiatives, including a program sponsored by the UN, Reuters, Sony, and the IUCN. He currently works for the corporate strategy group of a major financial institution and has great connections through his university's alumni network. My partner's responsibilities include:\n1) The legal, business, and sales stuff\n2) Securing funds\n3) Bringing in-depth knowledge of the enterprise market and the online collaboration needs of bigger businesses\n4) Handling the day-to-day business operations (once we really get going)<p>My partner and I work well together and this is a project we both care a lot about. We're looking for someone who is equally passionate and able to handle a serious debate about some random product feature-- then crack a joke and get along just fine afterward.

Using the Time Profiler in Apple's \"Instruments\" I measured the runtime of my face detector.<p>Initially I used OpenCV 2.1 compiled for the iPhone as described here:\nhttp://niw.at/articles/2009/03/14/using-opencv-on-iphone/en<p>However my first attempt yielded fairly poor results: it took 1500 to 6000 ms for face detection to complete on a 640x480px source image.<p>I then spent a few days getting OpenCV 2.2 to compile, mainly because it has some nice garbage collection features and also a new face detector (the LBP detector).<p>The first thing I tried fiddling with which algorithm was used.  I found that the LBP Face Detector was the fastest, however it wouldn't work on any of my asian friends.  Perhaps the dataset used to generate OpenCV's lbpcascade_frontalface.xml file was limited?  The available Haar Cascades however had no problem detecting asian faces or faces with very dark skin (definitely want to avoid an HP webcam fiasco), and among those I found haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml ended up being the fastest.<p>The next obvious thing to try was shrinking the image.  Scaling it down by a factor of 5.5 before feeding it into the face detector seemed to be the sweet spot for this application.  I used CoreGraphics to simultaneously convert the image to greyscale and shrink it, which I <i>believe</i> offloaded some of that to the GPU and I <i>know</i> gave a huge speed boost.<p>There are some performance parameters for the Haar Cascade that gave some speed boost as well.  You get to specify a window size (the smallest face it will recognize), which is a compromise between speed (larger window size) and not requiring the camera be ten inches from the subject's face (smaller window size).  I ended up going with a 20px x 20px window, which may seem small but remember the 5.5 image scaling factor, so really I'm requiring the face take up about a third of the 640x480px image.  I set the minimum neighbors to 4, the haar window scaling to 1.2, and set the CV_HAAR_FIND_BIGGEST_OBJECT and CV_HAAR_DO_ROUGH_SEARCH flags in the parameters I passed to the face detector.<p>The largest single boost however came in the way I converted the image formats.  As this was my first iPhone app I was startled at the number of image formats the different APIs used.  There are CGImages, CVPixelBuffers, UIImages, CMSampleBuffers, and more, and then OpenCV has its own format of course.  There are many code snippets out there on how to convert between the various formats, but here's where I would get sneaky.<p>As I was converting from a CVPixelBuffer (this is what the AVFoundation camera api returns) to CGImage, I simultaneously cropped the photo to the area of interest.  Then I found that I could simultaneously shrink, rotate, and grayscale-ify this image using various CGContext manipulations, and finally I pointed an OpenCV \"Mat\" buffer directly into the CGImage's data buffer, thus no actual conversion was necessary.  The data was only copied two times (instead of five or six as I was originally doing) and the GPU seemed to be doing some of the heavy lifting because I was able to get this to run in about 400ms.<p>The final speed boost that got the face detection down to about 50-100ms was using OpenCV's \"region of interest\" system, and setting the Region Of Interest in the image to the general area (plus or minus 50 pixels) where the last face was found (if there was one).  Thus the first time it finds a face, it scans the whole image (takes 400ms) and subsequent scans look at a much smaller area, and run at a speedy 50ms-100ms.<p>In LiveStache you'll notice the mustache updates location 3-5 times per second (on the iPhone 4 at least).  So why not more like 10 times per second if we're getting 100ms face detection times?  Because it takes processor time to draw the mustache, keep the video layer running, and keep the sound running.  Those add a little overhead and bring the speed down to a still-healthy 200-300ms.  I suspect on the iPhone 5 this will drop significantly, and we will be able to achieve real-time (10fps or so) face detection.<p>I hope this is helpful information for those of you with cool ideas that center around Face Detection.<p>Ian Charnas\nian.charnas@gmail.com", "date": "2011-02-15"}, {"title": "Augur decentralized prediction market open sources codebase", "URL": "", "text": "We&#x27;ve now gotten all augur contracts on the live Ethereum testnet.

Modern electronic circuits consume power when they switch states.  When a flip-flop inside a chip goes from 1 to 0 (or 0 to 1) power is required to make that change happen.  A flip-flop is made out of a number of transistors. The effect I am referring to actually happens at the transistor level.<p>A typical display processor hardware pipeline has millions of transistors performing different functions. From wide polyphase FIR filters for scaling to complex de-interlacing hardware (which also uses polyphase FIR filters).<p>While the interface to the display may only be 18, 24 or 30 bits wide, the image processing pipeline can easily be 64 or 128 bits wide within the processor chip.  This can easily result in hundreds of billions of state transitions per second within the chip.<p>Using the iPad as an example:<p><pre><code>  2048 x 1536 pixels\n  24 bits per pixel (assumption)\n  60 frames per second refresh\n  = 4.5E9 potential transitions per second\n  </code></pre>\nNow, this is JUST the interface.  The connection between the image processor and the LCD panel.  Within the image processor this continues and is multiplied many times over.  It's hard to come-up with a number, but I would not be surprised if the total is over 100 times greater, or over 500E9 (500 billion) potential transitions per second.<p>I say \"potential\" because the number of transitions are a function of the images being displayed.<p>When displaying relatively static and, more importantly, relatively uniform content, the transistors don't need to switch as often.  On the other hand, if the content has many transitions, lots of switching takes place.  And power consumption (and therefore device heating) can increase dramatically.<p>One example of such patterns that I remember testing probably ten years ago was a pattern where even pixels are white and odd pixels are black.  In other words, as many full pixel transitions as can be supported by the interface.  I remember burning my finger when I touched the FPGA.  This, BTW, was an accidental discovery while trying to debug a hardware problem that only occurred --you guessed it-- when images where noisy and busy.<p>Video is the perfect spoiler here.  And, if the video is noisy and of bad quality it can be even worst.  With video you can have almost random switching patterns covering most pixels on the display.  I also remember that helicopter-in-flight footage (camera aimed at the ground below) seemed to be particularly nasty because every single pixel is moving and there's potential for vibration and noise that simply makes everything jiggle.<p>I'm not sure if the thermal problems being brought-up by new iPad owners have anything to do with this, but hearing one of these reports on TV brought back memories of burning my finger on an FPGA when I accidentally discovered this little known side-effect of resolution.  From iPad 2 to 3 the screen got four times as many pixels.  And so, there's a potential for four times greater power consumption (by the display subsystem) and four times greater thermal requirements.  I'm not saying that this is what's going on.

It discovers the most important links in your Twitter timeline. It basically is a tool for Twitter pro users. The basic idea of the algorithm behind Chilitweets is to aggregate all tweets in your timeline based on unshortened and normalized URLs. What you get is a personalized news feed directly generated from your Twitter account.<p>I\u2019ve spend a lot of time on improving the UI of the URL list and on scaling the server backend. The server load is extremely high. The backend has to process huge amounts of tweets and URLs. They need to be unshortened and the page titles need to be loaded. For optimal results the tweets have to be aggregated over a period of several days. Which means I have to store most of the tweets for several days, too. This leads to a huge amount of data in the database. There were a lot of technical problems which needed to be solved in order to deploy this web app. I think the technical side of this project could be very interesting to you. The backend is now distibuted over several servers and I used cutting-edge technologies like nodeJS, Redis and MongoDB. The website itself is running with Python. I basically use node for all the hard HTTP work like unshortening of URLs and loading of page titles.

Seshn is a network comprised of personal websites (not profiles) where content is aggregated to feeds that are based on interests/passions and people are ranked based on influence within those areas. Our people discovery engine will allow users to discover the top people in areas that interest them. It's very minimalist and the UI/UX is stunning.<p>Unlike Tumblr we are focused on full-blown sites and people only. Blogging and syncing your social media to automate as posts will be a big part of our network, but we also want the user to be able to tell a story about who they are through different pages on their site and we have made it so easy to do so.<p>Another huge thing is data and style portability. If I wanted to take my Facebook profile with me along with all my content and self-host it, there is no way to do that. Same with Tumblr, same with Twitter, etc. Our platform has 100% full data AND style portability so you can take everything with you to a new host if you chose to leave someday. The bad thing is you won't get the benefit of the network, but you will have all of your data and style in tact to go where you please.<p>We are about to solve a HUGE problem with the broken web design industry through an innovative approach to e-commerce within our site. I can't really tell you details on how this is going to work but it's going to allow people to have gorgeous sites that look like they paid thousands of dollars for them. Some say this problem has already been solved, but it really hasn't because for a completely custom look on somewhere like Tumblr or a self-hosted site, there is still a learning curve involved or you still have to shell out some major bucks for the design. These problems will be solved within our platform and we can't wait to show everyone how it works.<p>I have been reading some of the news here on HN about people's complaints with Facebook lately and I was inspired to let you know whats coming from Seshn.

Major problems with my business & co-founder", "URL": "", "text": "Hello HN,<p>First off, I'm a regular HN member with 4-figure karma (if it matters). I'm at a loss and need advice.<p>I am the technical co-founder of a 5 year old company with $2M in annual revenue and 5 F/T employees. Over the past 18 months, I've become increasingly at odds with my business partner. My partner already has a relative working for us, then last year brought in a \"designer\" who is a close, personal friend and gave this person free reign on redesigning all of our print and web properties. Problem is, this person is a traditional graphic designer with no web experience. My design skills aren't superb, but I know UI/UX basics, how to measure and test things, seo fundamentals, etc. My partner has basically given this friend an executive marketing position.<p>Our traffic has been flat for a year or more. Our sales are down slightly. Instead of hustling, working on SEO/SEM, learning analytics and a/b testing, good product and customer development\u2013basically all the things a non-technical co-founder should do\u2013my partner and collegue waste countless hours dicking around with pointless design aesthetics or useless networking events. Over the same period, my partner has had personal issues as well (left his wife).<p>Last year, after some conflicts between myself and this designer, I told my partner this person had to go. He agreed but never followed through. When I pressed this issue, he simply claimed this person is \"too valuable\". Since then, we argue constantly. Maybe I'm wrong, but as I see it, a year + is a long enough \"experiment\" ... this person is doing nothing to improve sales, there's a major conflict of interest, and should go. With my business partner, we might be past the point where the damage can be repaired. There is definitely no trust on my part.<p>We each own 50% of the company and are the only board members. In multiple meetings with an attorney, I discovered that our company has no deadlock provision for resolving major decisions. Even more interesting\u2013I never signed the buy-sell agreement in our corporate papers (he did). So, technically, I could sell my stake to anyone at any time\u2013but he can only sell his shares back to the company. Other than an outside company acquiring all or half of the company, the only other option would be for me to move to simply dissolve and split or sell the assets.<p>There is so much technical knowledge about the business in my head, that I'm fairly certain it couldn't function well without me (at least not without a solid transition period).<p>What to do? I have a family and the company has treated me well financially. But there are a lot of things I still want to do startup and entrepreneur-wise. Do I give an ultimatum? Can I shop my half of the company to others in the industry without alarming them?<p>Thanks HN.
